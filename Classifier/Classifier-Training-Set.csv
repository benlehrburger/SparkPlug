":) I just checked and the emails I have received from Zenefits include Background check, Affordable care act info and background check results -- nothing on benefits election or signing in....  I am available now to 1:00 EST and again at 2:00 EST if you would like to call and check in.  Or better, what's a good time to call you?",Low-A
This is very cool.  I bet there are a lot of cool things I still don’t know about Herrmann.   :)  Enjoy today!,Low-A
Sounds like it was a great event!  Wonderful news.   Thank you all!,Low-A
Thank you for your help reminding me I was already set up.  Guess the first week was a bit of a blur :).  I am getting confirmation that my health care is being set up and it reminded me I never got back to you on HAS.  I think I will go with $2000 for HAS.  I am afraid I will not get through all of it even with dental.  The good news is we stay pretty healthy here.  (knock on wood)!  Let me know if you need anything further from me.,Low-A
"I have had the time to read the offer letter and other materials you sent and while it looks good in general, I do have a few questions, comments prior to signing.    1. We discussed growth, bonus or incentive"" and I don't see anything in the offer about that.  You mentioned you would follow up with Leslie about this and I am eager to hear what was discussed.  There is a lot of potential business growth I anticipate being a key driver of and support in, and I would like to see some ""reward"" for generating business growth. I would like to have this reflected in my offer letter.",Low-A
"2. The benefits not starting until 30 days after my start date are a surprise and this creates a hardship for me. Based on the language of the offer letter, if I started on Monday 2/29, I would be ""covered"" on March 1st. That would be far more appealing than waiting a month. My experience with other companies is benefits are covered as of day one regardless of start date. My proposal is that either start on Monday 2/29, so my benefits start on 3/1 or keep my start date 3/1 and make an exception to start my benefits immediately.",Low-A
"3. I am assuming the other points we discussed (email of 2/11 - agreements regarding prior work commitments and development dates) do not need to be in the offer.  They are ""professional"" agreements. That said, let me know if there is anything there that should be in writing.  4. On page 3 of the offer letter, it states I need to complete and sign the ""Herrmann International Application Form"".  Is this form on line or do you have a soft copy? It was not included with the other documents your sent me.    5. Regarding the benefits, I have a few questions - who would be best to speak with?    Thanks in advance for your help with these things.",Low-A
"Just an update regarding my email from yesterday.  I have connected with Shanna and she has shared the information needed regarding benefits.  I have also downloaded the employee handbook for some light Saturday reading and filled out the Zenefit info requested.   I know you are busy, and if it helps to connect over the weekend, I am around.  I look forward to hearing from you as you have time.",Low-A
Great Idea – I was thinking the same thing.,Low-A
Thank you for all you have done Betsy to help make this successful.,Low-A
Great Trick!  Thank you for sharing Dorothy!,Low-A
"I was telling Betsy about an interesting email I received from a CP based on the marketing email Beckie sent in my name asking CP’s for input.  She shared perhaps I could send it to the goodnews@hbdi.com internal distribution list, so I am sharing!  (I was not aware of this distribution list – but I like the idea :)).  The email is from Rosanne Vrugtman (below) giving us an update on things she is doing with HBDI and I think it’s “Good News”.   Enjoy your weekend.",Low-A
HeHe … I thought I heard that too!    Thank you Jeff!,Low-A
Facilitators have been communicated with regarding this upcoming change.,Low-A
"I am actually open on Tue as well (it’s showing blocked to 2 am CT because it’s to Midnight PST on my holiday calendar).  And Victoria, just a reminder, I am okay with calls as early as 6 AM PST, so if that works best for you I am good with that.   Back to you Victoria. :)",Low-A
"Perhaps we can invite them to the NY cert in November? Or do a BIG push to fill (might be worth it at 3-5 people).    We do have a Facilitator I was supposed to observe at this session (Bradley Humbles from BIG I think, he needs a session to become a Master Facilitator).  I am not 100% sure how to handle this.  I am not sure if he is being paid or this is an “unpaid” training to complete his master certification.  If the venue is free, and I am at expense, and Bradley is at expense, would it be worth it to get him and two people certified?  There may not be a profit, but we would get Bradley trained and two others on their way?   Open to the collective thinking.  What’s needed now?",Low-A
Sorry about Olivia not feeling well.  No worries.  I am good with sending what we have. I will send the slide as it to Ann Maxey and we will be complete! ….Until we need to decide who will present it :).,Low-A
"Thank you for the brainstorming time and Jeff, for the notes.  I have attached a walk-around version of the notes with a few new ideas.  Please take a look and add, subtract or modify based on your current thinking.  Victoria, I hope you got your daughter in time and have a wonderful evening.  If we do this via email we may not need another call, but whatever works best for all is good for me.",Low-A
"Thank you for making the modifications to the offer letter that help clarify our working partnership.  Attached please find signed documents for your files: 1. Offer Letter 2. HI Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete Agreement 3. HI Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement  I still need a link or form for the HI application.  On page 3 of the offer letter, it states I need to complete and sign the Herrmann International Application Form"".  It was not included with the other documents your sent me, can you or someone on the team send this along so I can complete it? """,Low-A
Thank you for the feedback on the work with Kyle.  Always good to know about.  I would be happy to be on a call with Tencap Sports.  The initiative sound great!  I know we have think Monday and I would be happy to (may be best if we can) be on a call Mon 10/24 or 10/31.  I am also available 11/1 and after that we jump to 11/8 and forward.  My calendar is current so pick a time that is not already busy for any of those days.  Thanks for thinking of me.,Low-A
"Thank you for sending this forward.  I was not aware of this and would LOVE for someone to walk me through the tool.    Christina or Betsy – can one of you schedule time to review this the week of 6/13 – My calendar is current if you want to set up some time.  And as a reminder, any time from 6 am PST on is good.   I look forward to learning more.",Low-A
Nice to hear from you. Sorry for the slow reply - my whirlwind is still happening - I am hoping the weekend gives me a bit of a breather.  I have my first draft of the roadmap and will be ready to discuss with you early next week if/as you may have time Sarah.  Let me know a couple of possible times and we can make a meeting.  Sarah - Thank you for the connection and introduction to Brenda - I would love to help with the virtual delivery/design of ANY Herrmann product.  It's fairly straight forward and I enjoy it.  I have worked with Ashley on a price point so there may even be info on the back end in the Herrmann ethers.   Brenda - I would love to catch up.  I am wide open for a call Monday (all day) and Tuesday (up to 1:00 PST).  Is there a good time to catch up?  I am good to be on calls as early as 9:00 AM EST/6:00 AM PST.  I hope you both have a wonderful weekend.,Low-A
"Thanks Victoria for checking in and getting the conversation started.  I would like to schedule at least one call to be in a conversation about the company being virtual.  While it’s true many of us are virtual, I think to Jeff’s point, there may be some opportunities for us to share tips and tricks regarding being virtual and I think there is room for a conversation about creating an even better virtual experience for all.   I find myself wondering about the “assumptions” we hold about being virtual that may be missed conversations/opportunities for deeper discussion because it’s so familiar.  Thoughts?  Enjoy the long weekend and the entry into the New Year!",Low-A
Thank you for the Personas information.  It's interesting insight.  Wed 3/9 still works -- I am available Wed 3/9 from 1-3 EST/10-12 PST.  If that does not work I am currently open from 11:00 EST on both Thur 3/10 and Friday 3/11.   Just send an invite for what will work best for you.  Please send it to both emails as I don't yet have my computer to track meetings well.  I look forward to connecting soon.,Low-A
It was great meeting you as well.  I am looking forward to more learning about Marketing and working together.     Thank you for the HubSpot info.  I look forward to the tutorial next week.  In the meantime I will answer the questions from the L&OD vs. consultant perspective.,Low-A
"Thank you for the note.  Very provocative and will require some more thinking on my part.  I would love to connect and best days next week are Monday 4/18  or Wednesday 4/20.  I like the early morning calls (6am on) because it’s quiet and I can focus – but whatever works for you.  My outlook is current, so choose a time and let’s connect again.",Low-A
Thank you for the update.  So happy it’s not an emergency and they are doing what’s needed soon. I am keeping you in my prayers and sending lots of blessings.,Low-A
"Based on the info in Hubspot I would imagine it’s a lead from Friday’s session in NH with Kyle Steadman.  Both Jeff and I were handing out cards and he collected some names, so her name may be in his list.  I gave him the business cards that came to me.  It is Zecharia’s territory, I believe Jeff was there helping out and going to share the leads he collected wit Zechariah.  FYI I was recently given a bunch of “free” cards to give to people, so it may be good to put my name in the dropdown list/form.  I would be interested in seeing who takes it :).   I was wondering how we tracked the free card uses.  Once the people take the assessment does the sales lead get notified/a copy of the report to reach out and do a debrief?  Or a better question – what’s the process for the person to get their result and do they get a soft or hard copy?",Low-A
"Thank you for all you are doing to support this initiative.  Are the free HBDI cards the diversity cards?  I did get on line and learn more about what Kyle delivered last year (see attached).  Just an FYI, but some insight.  It’s a little frightening and I am concerned there is ONLY 1 hour.  I am glad we are meeting with him early next week.",Low-A
Thanks for the clarification.  Yeah – there are a lot of cooks!  I will try to stay a sous-chef.  Hope all is well in your world.,Low-A
"These look great!   Thank you again for all your time and support with this project.   Kyle, for my current review of the slides I like keeping the “optional” activities in.  We can discuss further Friday morning.  See you at 8 am Friday.",Low-A
"I am sad to learn you are leaving and I hope it’s for the good and you have some great plans for your future. I will miss working you.  Are you on Linked In?  As Karim mentioned, he would like me to do a “exit interview”.  Typically this is a good way to get perspective on what the catalyst for your exit is, and to gather information that I can share back to the leaders about things they can start, stop or modify.   Karim mentioned we could be on a call Wed. the 21st however I will be traveling to Boston that day.  I am available a lot on Mon 19th and Tue the 20th (my outlook is current if you want to send a meeting request.  I am open as early as 6 AM PST/9 AM EST).  If you would rather, I can set up the meeting, just send a couple times that may work for you and I will schedule the meeting.   I think setting the meeting for an hour would be good.  We may not need the entire time, but I would rather schedule more and use less.   What works best for you?",Low-A
"Thanks for the quick reply.  This is a conversation with just me, which will also be more comfortable for me. :)  I can chat tomorrow from 4:30 on, or I am flying back from IN on Friday and land around 2 PM PST/5 EST.  If you are not too busy late in your day, I can call when I land.  I can chat over the weekend also. I am running a neighborhood yard sale, but can be on a call either from 6 PM EST/3 PM PST forward on Sat. or  on Sunday either early – 6 AM or 7 PST/9 or 10 AM EST  or 3 PM PST forward.   What works best for you?  Let me know and I can schedule a zoom call.",Low-A
4:30 PM EST tomorrow works well.  What is the best # to call you on?   Let me know as you can and I will plan on calling you then.,Low-A
Happy to be on a call and think about positioning.  I will take a peek at the links between now and then to get a grasp of her thinking.    Do you want to set the meeting up or should I?    Let me know as you can.,Low-A
"My calendar is current and I would be happy to discuss as it might work best for you.  I think you should be able to see my calendar, but let me know if not and I will send you a view.",Low-A
I would be happy to make time.  I have a pretty open calendar for design next week if you want to pick a time.   I really am okay with calls as early as 6 AM PST if that helps.   If there is a link to review in advance please let me know.  If it’s best to walk through together that’s fine as well.  Whatever you think is best.,Low-A
"I am not 100% sure it’s the best referral, but I can connect with a VP of Sales at Altera who I worked closely with.  I wouldn’t really recommend talking with Kjell – but Dan Sheehy could speak from a customer perspective about the use of HBDI to represent cognitive diversity.",Low-A
I have nothing specific to add at the moment  - will let you know if that changes.,Low-A
What I got from Zenefits was the email for the background check.  Was that also benefits elections?  I will check again.  If I cannot find it I will reconnect with you.,Low-A
I have these two days booked “hold” on my calendar. :)  Let me know when the date is confirmed.,Low-A
"Sorry to hear there is so much challenge with your Mom and I do hope she is okay!  That's a lot of work and worry for you and I certainly understand, it takes precedent.  I would make the same choice.  I will use the hbdi address and try again.  I will connect with you if I can't figure it out or need anything.  Will it be best to email or call?  Hope your Mom is okay and heals quickly.",Low-A
Perfect … as you can.  I am here :),Low-A
I look forward to catching up.,Low-A
For keeping the conversation going and taking an action to document what we know.    If there is a way I can help at all please let me know.,Low-A
This is great insight and it’s convenient to have all the links in one email.  You Rock! :),Low-A
This provides good insight!,Low-A
I will work on it and send along more info by end of my day tomorrow.,Low-A
I enjoyed our call today and was sorry to have it end so quickly.  I loved learning about Hubspot.  Clearly I have a steep learning curve about a lot of the marketing “stuff”.  I look forward to learning more.  I will fill this journey page out and get it back to you by COB Wed.  Does that work okay?   Let me know if you need it sooner.,Low-A
Great idea!  It was a lot and very fast paced:).  Great way to learn and learn what more there is to learn!,Low-A
I appreciate your coordinating and managing this process.,Low-A
Thanks for the heads up Dominic.  Hope you are feeling better soon.,Low-A
"Thanks for the update JT.    Please send all the call in information along as you have it.   When you speak with your contact, since our hour is being blended into a bigger session, could you check on two things:   1. Would she share the full agenda – & the participant list?  Having the context they are working in & names, helps me prepare better and weave in their reality.  2. Ask if there will be someone introducing me and if there are any slides from their session that should be blended into my deck?  3. Should I send someone my deck as a back-up?  Donna/Kim:  For whoever is sending the team Dashboard please send it in powerpoint.  Has this group taken the team report?  BTW – I am assuming they have all had an individual debrief.  Is that accurate?   Please confirm.",Low-A
"Good summary.  Is this a “process” that everyone uses and knows?  Does our operations/marketing group know/follow this process?   I am assuming that given this process, I would be a “CRM” (In hubspot).  I will pass out leads at trainings/presentations and as I travel.  I like the idea about being discerning about when I debrief (big potential clients is good).  Are there other steps/thoughts?   Is an example of the type of thing we don’t have a set, understood by all process for?  I would propose we do what is needed to make a standard process that is known by all.  Does that make sense?   Think day thoughts :),",Low-A
Welcome Jeff –   I look forward to working with you and meeting you soon at the Company gathering.,Low-A
You guys are rock stars!  GREAT idea.  It will be fun to see how it works.,Low-A
Welcome Dali –   I hope you  enjoy your time with us.  Joe will be great to partner with and learn from.,Low-A
I also want to follow up I went and asked Val who did this need to go to for me to set up her order in Netsuite and she informed me that since Quinton has reached out to her for me to put him as the owner. So I went and changed the record from Donna to Quinton in hubspot.,Low-A
It showed up in service.,Low-A
"Yes, you are ready to send out the invite for individuals to begin taking their assessment.  If you have any more questions Kim Zappel will be your Account Manager and she will be happy to help assist you.  I have copied her on this email so you will have her contact information.

I will handle it for you!,Low-A
Please see attachment for list of Self-Processing Clients!,Low-A
Mine have been updated!!,Low-A
I think that is a good idea kim!,Low-A
Looks Great Thank You!!!,Low-A
Sorry I dove right in but I'm home as well!,Low-A
I have a call scheduled at 10 am on that day.,Low-A
I received it!,Low-A
That is correct,Low-A
So my hire date is wrong in the Zenefits portal this is what it has listed:  And my hire date was 10/12/2015.,Low-A
Ok awesome. Thank you,Low-A
I was wondering if I was going to be paid for the holiday’s since I have only been here a little over a month?,Low-A
Thank you so much Shanna.,Low-A
Ok Great thanks !!!,Low-A
I also had a question about Dependent Care spending account how do we sign up for that ?,Low-A
I never received the email from Zenefits to log in.,Low-A
Can you please confirm her price level to attend the certification?,Low-A
"Now that we have the dates confirm for the Palo Alto certification, can each of you please take a look at your applications received and let me know which individuals you have that are planning to attend in March.",Low-A
"Unfortunately, we have hit the max capacity that the room could hold also the material order for certification has already been processed.  I can add her to the February certification that runs from the 7-9th.",Low-A
"Hi, Toni. It looks like Lockheed Martin is still listed as the bill-to address on these HBDIs. I need to make sure that these invoices were not sent to LM, can you please confirm?   Thank you!   I reached out to Jessica and provided the correct Bill to address for her to resend the invoice with correct information.",Low-A
"I wanted to inform you of some challenges I am experiencing with one our clients -Wilhelmina Parker-Bentum at the City of Berkeley.  I trained Wilhelmina in the HTMS database on February 9, 2016. Since then she has repeatedly contacted me on how to navigate the system.   Even though I have repeatedly provided step-by-step instructions on how to perform basic tasks such as searching for individuals in the database, creating groups and generating reports she still contacts both Quinton and me for help on a frequent basis.  I have told her about the capabilities that Axon has verses HTMS in hopes to persuade her to want to get migrated over more quickly. However, she has still not taken the steps in the process to move forward with the Axon migration process.   Any advice that you may have for how I am to move forward with the client will be greatly appreciated.",Low-A
"No worries, I was just confused as it appeared that someone else had responded to the client after my service coverage ended so I didn't understand why I was looped back in.  Joe or Dorothy typically help with issues like this; so I assumed that sending it to one or both of them would be more effective for the client.   Once we hear back from Dorothy I'm happy to respond to the client if that's what I need to do; but someone sent an email from service saying they had also helped this same client on Friday - so I don't see the consistency in AM's so far for this client. I think what's most important is that the issue gets resolved and they won't care who that comes from. Just my opinion though.  Happy to do whatever.",Low-A
Laurel sent her practicum order in for individual reports and a pair report. I failed to include the pair report on the order. She didn't notice it on the order estimate and we shipped just the individual reports. I have sent her the soft copy pair report and set up a new order for her to receive the hard copy with shipping/handling on us.,Low-A
"It is with great pleasure for me to virtually introduce you to my newest partner here at Herrmann, Andrea Longfellow.  Andrea will be here to support your organizational needs and utilization of the HBDI, and of course, I will still be here to support all of your ordering needs!   I have no doubt that you will enjoy working with Andrea as much as I am.  We both look forward to our continued partnership with you!",Low-A
"Good point! Yes, that sounds like a plan!",Low-A
Is nice to be right sometimes isn’t it? LOL!   Hope you have a great day!,Low-A
No worries; I'm good.  Let me know if you need anything.  :),Low-A
"LinkedIn? I'm sure you probably already did this by now.   Let me know if you need me to help with this.  I am sorry I forgot to tell you yesterday that I've been dealing with some non-life threatening health issues. Currently, I've got a cyst on my right ovary that is 4cmx4cm (OUCH) and they believe I have endometriosis so I may need surgery to relieve the pain that I'm experiencing. I'm working at home as much as I can. If you need anything call me. I'll know more next Wednesday when I meet with the doctor I've been trying to see for a couple of months.  If I log off early today I'll let you know.",Low-A
Voicemail for you from Anne Griswold..not sure why she called my extension lol,Low-A

I’m going to work on the report this afternoon.,Low-A

I am well and I hope you are also.  Brenda Reuter is the Client Relationship Manager for Coca-Cola. I've copied her on this email to assist with your request.  What type of training are you wanting to schedule?,Low-A
No doubt! Hope your kids are enjoying it!,Low-A
I don't think our fulfillment company is going to be open today so it won't ship until Tuesday and will arrive next Friday. Will that work or do you need me to ship it 2 day or overnight?  Happy SNOW day! :),Low-A
"Here you go.  I'll be logging off in the next 15 minutes. My sister-in-law's water broke this morning so we are going to go see the baby before this storm comes in. :)  I'll log back on later this afternoon so if you need anything I'll take care of it then. You can call or text me if you need anything while I'm gone.",Low-A
"It was processed on Friday and shipping today. Should arrive on the 21st.  Sorry for the delay; all my fault for sure :(  All of our team members are back and the cert and workshops are done, so things should be back to normal now.",Low-A
She is starting to feel better. And now I’m pretty sure I’ve got a UTI…dang what is up with this week??  I am taking tomorrow off; she has a field trip tomorrow so I’m going to do that with her. Won’t be much longer and she won’t want me to do things like that.,Low-A
BAHAHA! Is it Friday yet?  I’ll get that one to you in just a bit!,Low-A
I believe Dorothy will have that answer.   Paul would have been the contact but he retired (not sure if you knew that) so she is the one to go to for IT questions now.  If you want me to reach out to her I'm happy to. Just let me know.,Low-A
I had to go have my blood drawn this morning and it took FOREVER. I'm just now getting in the office. I am going to check my orders and once I get to a good place I'll give you a call. It will be before noon. So sorry!,Low-A
"Just checking in to see if you were able to assist Silke with his second profile?   Brenda has a call with Lei tomorrow and this is on their agenda, so she wanted me to check in with you.",Low-A
"No update yet. I have reached out to Dorothy; she was in a meeting all morning and some of the afternoon. I just stopped by her office but she was on a phone call; so I’ll try her again before I leave, and let you know.   Sorry for the untimely response. :(",Low-A
I am SO sorry! I completely forgot to send this to you last week. I checked and nothing is new as of today.,Low-A
I sent an updated order estimate; but noticed that I put the materials to your attention after I sent the order estimate. I have updated the order to reflect the orders be sent to Shane’s attention instead of yours. My apologies for the confusion.  Please let me know if you see anything else that needs to be updated.,Low-A
Sorry I'm just now replying. I just got done working on the January cert.  I know Dorothy was working on it last week. I'll be in the office tomorrow so I'll stop by her office and see where she is at on this. I'm hoping she reached out to Silke since it's been a while.,Low-A
I gave you a ring and left a voicemail. You can call me either at my extension or 828-289-4229. I'll be at my desk until 5.,Low-A
"I'm online now, I'll have to run my daughter to my MIL's house as soon as she rises. I'm thinking around 9ish and they only live 2 minutes away so I shouldn't be offline long.   I'm flexible with that though, so you just let me know and I'll work around your schedule.  Hope you had a great weekend!",Low-A
"No, I put my call on hold last week when some discussion was going on about migrating their data into Axon. Dorothy scheduled a call at 3 today with Colleen to introduce her into Axon, would you be available to attend?  I know Val and I discussed looping you in once this was confirmed (it was confirmed yesterday) so I sincerely apologize for not looping you in yesterday!!  I’ll be on the call today if you aren’t able to make it and will be happy to fill you in on any info I get.",Low-A
I'm taking care of the order for Alcoa below. But wanted to send this your way for the contact info of the individual requesting the order.  Let me know if you need anything.,Low-A
"I was able to locate Lee Blackburn, but unable to locate a profile for Jeremy Lauzon. I can search for him by email if you would like; just let me know what email he would have used.",Low-A
I haven’t; he gave me everything I needed to get the order set up. I was going to send it to him and ask him to use it for future orders. I’ll cc you on it.,Low-A
Hooray!! :),Low-A
"That’s what I thought, but wanted to check with you.",Low-A
I looked up everyone except for those outside of the US :),Low-A
"Per your request, below are the completions for the groups mentioned in the subject line:  Account Set II:  1. ALTMAN, HEATHER 2. CONDRY, AMY 3. LEDINGHAM, CHRIS 4. PARENTE, NICK 5. WIBLE, NATALIE  Research & Marketing Intelligence:  1. ANDERSON, AMY 2. BOORTZ, GREG 3. BURNETTE, KEITH 4. COPIC, DEJAN 5. DEAL, DAVID 6. EHRLICH, JIM 7. GELBER, RACHEL  It appears there are missing individuals for the Account Set II group, and that all 27 have completed for the Research & Marketing Intelligence group.  Before I can move forward with processing the order for the completed group, I need to connect with you. I want to be sure I create the order correctly and that you receive everything that you need.  In regards to the Account Set II group; how should I proceed? Is there a scheduled debrief date for this group?  I believe that a phone call would be most efficient, so if you could give me a call at your earliest convenience that would be great.",Low-A
"I attached our correspondence where I let her know that this group would need to be complete by 11/5 to process and ship our standard method (3 day). Clearly, she is overwhelmed with management of these groups, and needs some assistance. My reason for sending her an update today is because I'm at the point that I need to know what to do since some have still not completed and her 'ideal need by date' is 11/12.  Hopefully, I'll hear from her soon.",Low-A
"Personally, I think for people like him (that provide all the info needed to create the order) it’s okay not to send it back to have them fill in info they’ve already provided. What I’ll do is send him the new order template and roster and ask that he use it going forward. I’ll send it to Gretchen as well; which will hopefully prevent the chaos we went through with her last orders. Sound good?",Low-A
"Thank you for the below information.  I'm still missing the below:  When do you need the Market Research materials in hand?  When is the session date for the Account Set II Group?  In regards to the completion updates, typically, when a client has access to their database we aren't asked to provide completion updates, but I'm always happy to assist in times of need. The link below is also a helpful resource to check on completions at your convenience:   https://htms.hbdi.com/roster/   You will just enter the access code for the group you want to see completions for and voilà! :)   So, it looks like I just need your need by date for both groups and we will be all set.",Low-A
"I hope this email finds you well. Per my email below from Thursday I need to connect with you prior to processing the Research & Marketing Development request. Everyone in the group has completed; but there are missing items that we need to confirm before I process the order.  Also, for the Account Set II group there are only 5 individuals that have completed in this group and I am unable to locate any correspondence to provide a need by date.   Please respond at your earliest convenience to allow us to provide you with the correct materials.",Low-A
So far no response and no email confirming she has read it. :(,Low-A
"Ha, ha! I don’t know either!",Low-A
You can use the info in my signature if that makes it easier for you :),Low-A
I actually sent Val an email about it earlier. This was a problem I experienced before I ever left. I'm hoping we can get to the bottom of it sooner rather than later. As you saw Kevin's response - it's a bit of a pain to have to re-apply.  I cc'd Val so she would be aware that this is the 2nd person for you as well.,Low-A
"Nope, I’ll take care of it.",Low-A
"I just left you a voicemail but wanted to follow up with an email.  The user name you are referring to is for the CP site, correct? Just want to be sure I reset the correct user name.  Yes, Transamerica is in Axon already; I was able to pull the attached list of assessments that have been taken at Transamerica. Let me know if you have any questions about the numbers or how to pull this report.   I believe Maria discussed SP with Melissa Roney (which I just realized I haven’t sent her an introductory email for you – I’ll do that now – and so sorry for the delay in doing so). Not sure they have had the resources in the past to do so but perhaps with Randy there he can make that happen.   Hope this helps!  Due to Thanksgiving do you want to change our 1:1 to tomorrow, that way we can connect on any items that may be outstanding before the holiday? If not, that is fine, just wanted to offer that.",Low-A
"Yes, I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to take care of this yesterday. You can let Kendra know you will have the instructions to her by this afternoon. I'm going to work on it now.  Do you want me to send her the instructions and cc you?",Low-A
Thursdays at 4 my time would be perfect! Looking forward to connecting with you! If you need to connect today let me know; I’ve got a doctor appointment this morning so I will be unavailable from 10:30 my time until the appointment is over. But this afternoon is pretty open if you would like to chat.,Low-A
"Unfortunately, I am still without an insurance card. I tried to login to the website, but was unsuccessful. I’ve been busy as I’m sure you have as well. I am anticipating a few doctor appointments in January, so if there is any way you can help me out it is greatly appreciated.",Low-A
Happy to help anyway I can.,Low-A
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA!!!!!,Low-A
FYI.   I set the order up so there is no action needed on your end. Just wanted you to know that I had already reached out to JT & Donna before Quinton sent his email. Didn’t mean to not cc you on my email.,Low-A
"Since I’m such a great cook, I’ll bring plates. :)",Low-A
I see that you already did lol; never mind!   :),Low-A
"I went through everything and everything you told him he is missing – he really is missing. Do you want me to reach out to him with my answers below, or do you want to? (Oh – all the answers except the last one of course lol!)  The predicted preferences exercise that I completed was for Colleen Araco, not Ellen Trytek.  – need one for Ellen as well; can’t just do one.   The Evaluation for Ellen and debrief forms are one of the 2 Pairs Exercises that I completed – These summaries are also attached in the pdf links that are listed below – If you page through the pdf links,I believe that you will see them.  The Team Findings is also in the pdf link as well. – Need plans and evaluations for the individual debriefs as well; not just the pair exercises  Am I not understanding this correctly? – no you completely missed the target. LOL!  Want to send me another one?",Low-A
See below. She says she emailed me about this lady last week but I think she meant you…let me know if you need me to do anything.,Low-A
Thanks for the update. Kim will be back in the office tomorrow so you can send her the new need by date once you receive the information.,Low-A
"Hmm, you may want to ask Joe or Leslie to add you to the call group. I don't know of a way to add a line from the app.   But, adding you to the call group should do the trick.",Low-A
"Awesome call and great recap on slack!   PS sales team, I’ve updated the MLP with the Axon sandbox area for DPP client demos. Just make sure you let Andrew know when you schedule these demos, because if they are working on development in the sandbox it will disrupt your demo! (no Bueno!)",Low-A
Quite timely!   Quick question – do you have the ai files for this 2016 letterhead? I need to make a UK version.,Low-A
"Hi Karim, I sent you an email with the hotel extensions for my team plus Marla for Tuesday and Wednesday night. Did you not receive it??",Low-A
We’re all in our company meeting this week! We’ll send you emails.,Low-A
"Great feedback – let’s discuss in our call in 2 minutes!  In general, I want more color! Esp for 1-pages, these need to be eye-catching, which is why I think we should use a LOT more color. Color blocks or patterns. Not too busy, but draws the attention of the viewer.",Low-A
"We just wrapped up a GREAT session at SHRM (that’s the annual conference for HR professionals). Ann presented her session “Diversity of Thought: Where D&I Meet the Bottom Line” to an audience of ~175 people.   Some people gave us their business cards, so the sales team will receive leads from that.   If you get any requests for the materials (if anyone calls or emails), please direct them to the landing page below (“There are a lot of diversity of thought resources, so check it out!”), or go there yourself and put in their name and email address for them to be added to the list.   We’ll get most of our leads via our landing page, where people will sign up to request the session slides, request a demo, and access the following:   -          Diversity of Thought White Paper -          Inclusive Leadership Playbook -          Diversity of Thought webinar replay -          Inclusive Leadership webinar replay -          Diversity of Thought toolkit",Low-A
"I don’t believe he has this on his radar at all – I’m not sure if he’s ever done these Biz cards before.  Jen, I looked in the folder that you migrated from DB and I can’t find any of the current business cards in there. Do you know where they mihgt be? Would Christina know?  Once we get Steve set up with the design files and profiles, he can do them.",Low-A
"Hey super stars, Joe and I found an easy way to move all of the HERRMANN DESIGN folders and contents from Dropbox into our hbdi.com Google Drive.   We are doing that RIGHT NOW (the upload will take about 30 minutes). I will send out a message when it’s done and I share the new Google Drive Folders with you. After we move it to Google Drive, please DO NOT use the Dropbox folder anymore. If you are working in that folder right now, you may have to re-save your files to Google.   I will be doing the same with EACH Dropbox folder I have access to, and will be sending a similar message to each group affiliated with that folder.   Our goal is to not use Dropbox anymore. It’s not secure, and we need to move everything over to Google.   Let Joe know if you have any questions :)",Low-A
"No, have to cancel (sorry!).  I haven’t reviewed the reseller brochure edits yet, but if I find any typos, I’ll send them via Adobe. I got the two model and walk around templates (thank you!!) Just waiting on the other product docs :)",Low-A
"Can you send me any images you have of the thinker journey? I’m creating a PPT presentation and I’d love to add that in.  Also, I need some people with profile visuals to illustrate:  My thinking (person with profile over head) me+you (2 ppl interacting with profiles over head) My team (team… with above) My organization (org… with above)  Do you have anything like that?",Low-A
"Wow Chris, this is coming together so nicely!! I put some feedback below, in line with your email so I could make sure I get to all of your questions.",Low-A
"I don’t think this sits very high in terms of priorities, which is why you might want to let us “take this” and just let us tell you what we need from you. I know Yosuke wants to talk to you about making the forms match your mock ups as much as possible, but that’s a different conversation than what we’re doing, insofar as reengineering the forms and surveys.",Low-A
"Go for it Virlina.  One edit: With the info graphic for symptom, problem, solution... the solution is not the products. The solutions are thinking agility, thinking diversity, etc. then how we do it is thru the products.",Low-A
Thanks. Am about to dive in now.,Low-A
"Happy Friday – a few updates for you:  1. Q4 Email Campaign: We sent the email below to previously inactive contacts who opened our promo #4 email from 2 weeks ago. Since different offers may appeal to different folks, we’re testing the approach of letting them choose which offer (because on these contacts, we have minimal data). 2. The Diversity of Thought White Paper is now available: Please feel free to send the link to any HR/D&I prospects as you see fit. It can also be a great tool to use in your messages w/ LinkedIn Sales Navigator to strike up a conversation w/ prospects in your targeted accounts.  We will be doing a broader marketing push with the White Paper in Q1.  3. We are working on a business summary for the Diversity white paper because this current white paper is very HR-heavy.",Low-A
"Cool!  Ok, Jen, let's get a App webinar on the books in late July. Coordinate their calendars for date and give us enough time to promote. Typical webinar invitation email for all Cps (app list), landing page. Content: TBD,can use the App guidelines for Cps that Hanna, Virlina, and I created. It would be a you've heard about it, hopefully downloaded it, now let's talk about how to get the most out of it""""",Low-A
"This morning on the leadership team call, we talked about our larger need for a Herrmann file sharing system. Implementation of DatAnywhere has been less than successful so far, and Karim and I are lobbying for a more accessible file sharing system. Dropbox is OK, but we're voting for Box. Dorothy and John will review some options. It may mean that DatAnywhere is the right solution at the end of the day, in which case, this images.herrmann will be a moot point.   That (choosing a file share system) is a parallel work stream to what I've asked though, because I don't want our longer term goals to prevent immediate accessibility.   Does that make sense?",Low-A
See attached.,Low-A
"I defer to Christina as our Lead Designer to decide who now has permissions to redesign and alter marketing and product material, and what technology platform they use.   In my opinion, Microsoft Word, though widely available, does not support professional design specs. Now that we have Christina, we don't need to democratize the creation of any designed material – marketing or product. MS Word and the other Office products are great for providing mock ups to Christina, but final production should be done using the tools she uses.",Low-A
"Great news! Thank you for sharing, Maria!",Low-A
"All, I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate you all participating in this important CUSTOMER JOURNEY exercise this week. Especially to Lez, your input and expertise was so valuable, and I wish we could keep you in the States for longer!  I will work on a full write up for the entire company (and Global!) to make them aware of the great work we are doing, and also, I will make sure that this work does not stop. We purposefully ignored certain areas (attraction and sales process, the rest of the CP journey, inspiring our thinkers and CP's to promote and market Herrmann themselves, the HUB experience) so we can give them the full attention they deserve. I have already talked to some Sales team members, including Dominic, and they are VERY excited about this work, and some will be joining us as we dig deeper into the customer journey.   You'll hear from me more after my vacation next week.",Low-A
"Bowman, can you please make a quick copy change on the website today?",Low-A
"For these thinker submissions, we need to decide on a process so we don't look disorganized in our follow ups to thinker questions. Typically, this would go to Service, but since it's an easy look-up, the first person on this email who can handle it could reply all – got it"" and then CC service on the response?  What do you (all) think?""",Low-A
They are all so different; it's hard to give a preference.,Low-A
"Thanks Tracy! Can you please load these into Basecamp? We are in the phase of compiling all the website resources mentioned in the book so we can decide which need reformatting, etc.   Marla, Danny will reach out to you about the CEO country data.",Low-A
"Hey Bowman, do you have any detail on the projects to provide (did you submit an invoice on Friday)?  After talking to people on his team, Karim wants to bring you in for specific projects, only, and to have complete visibility into them. His budgets very tight, and he's very mindful of the time each person spends in Product. He will expect to see reduced hours going towards Product, and he will likely questions the hours spent in Product if he doesn't know what they are for.  We will keep you busy in Marketing, and I still need the hourly detail.",Low-A
Great way to start a week! Great work Jill!,Low-A
Is it set up yet? How's it working?,Low-A
"Yes, let's chat… I don't love that our blog is on a separate domain… but we should talk before you make any big changes.   In more future-focused news, we are making headway with our global colleagues on designing one new website for all of Herrmann. Just keep that in mind with the changes you're making now.",Low-A
"For context, Yosuke will help look holistically at the plugins and analytics for our web presence. He’s a valuable resource with lots of experience in website optimization, and instead of needing to delegate to you and Bowman, he’ll be able to make a lot of those changes himself (after consulting you for implications, of course).",Low-A

"Hi all, our Forestry study is an important piece of collateral that explains the “66% more effective” quote we use. Has it gone through rebranding yet, to our CURRENT brand (not the 2017 rebrand)? If so, please make sure the file is replaced in Hubspot. If not, Jen, can you put that into the queue for Steve? Marla, take a look to see if the paper needs major edits.",Low-A
"Hi Ann, excited to see the revised version!",Low-A
"I’d still like to meet tomorrow for 1-1; even to touch base briefly. I see that you moved our meeting to Friday; is there no time you’re available before the LT meeting?  During our 1-1, I’d love to review what ideas you (and I) both have about how you could help drive and own some initiatives for Marketing in 2016 and beyond! I know the split role has been a challenge, and than you for sticking with us while we muddle through that. You have been so valuable handling complete projects for us, and I’d love to still be able to count on you for 2016 for the current projects and new ones, but let’s have a conversation about it. I want to get you out of smaller marketing Ops tasks to free up more time for bigger projects, but I don’t want to assign you something before chatting.",Low-A
"I just want to make sure everyone saw the Feb Debrief newsletter for Certified Practitioners, out today for all of our CPs!   This fabulous 8-page newsletter is chock full of great content for our Practitioners, compiled by Beckie and Marla.   This month’s newsletter features an interview with Symmetric’s David Szen on how to deal with multi-generational workplaces, a reflection on “Mental Math and the Fine-Tuning of Emotions” by Sandra J. Ackerman, links to resources on how to “connect the dots” with better Whole Brain Communication, and introduces our new resource series for Practitioners, the “HBDI Community of Practice” webinars with Anne Griswold.   Thank you Beckie and Marla for your excellent work on this value-add for our most important evangelists, our Certified Practitioners!",Low-A
"Reminder for everyone if you have a client who has an ego, nominating them for a joint award is a great relationship builder!  Who has a client doing cool stuff?",Low-A
"Sounds good, Kyle! I would like to schedule a connection between you and Anne Griswold so you two are on the same page before the presentation. Sound ok? Maybe next week?  Also, my deadline for submitting handouts to our printer is 9/28, so unless I hear from you with any change, I will fwd the handouts that I sent to you. If you have any edits, please send them to me tomorrow.",Low-A
"We can send the email, I’m just doubtful that this email will make a difference given the short amount of time A discount may fill the class more effectively.",Low-A
Hi Shanna! The interviews with Beckie Moses are going very well. Her final interview with Ann Herrmann is on Wednesday. Might you be available on Thursday or Friday for an hour interview with her to go through any other questions she might have?   She and I have talked about negotiating for more time off – she has a preplanned week’s vacation during the summer that I told her we may be able to build into her PTO allotment (basically that it wouldn’t count against her 10-day accrual for the 1st year of employment). Would that be possible?,Low-A
"There is a lot of fuzziness about the “herrmann team” members, and I’d like to ask your recommendation, Shanna, and get a decision from you, Ann, about who we should include on the website (and holiday card, too, because that is related).   I agree that Bill should be deleted from the website since he is no longer employed, but for all the contractors/consultants we work with, should they be included on the website as part of the Herrmann team, or not?  http://www.herrmannsolutions.com/about/  If we include Tracy, we should include all contractors (Marla, Danny, etc), unless we create an exception for contractors who are client-facing (as Tracy is).   What is the protocol here? It would help my team immensely to have guidelines that prevent this emailing back and forth every time.",Low-A
Hi Shanna! I have not yet received my Zenefits login email :(,Low-A
"Beckie asked some specific questions about the offer, and I’d love your help in getting all the info gathered.  Can you each look below to see Beckie’s questions and supply guidance or answers where you can?  I’m excited to move forward!",Low-A
It looks like I need a password to access this site?  Can you provide me one?,Low-A
"team, I just talked to Ann – we’re going to reschedule this practice to 10AM-10:30AM tomorrow morning.  I’ll take care of that in GTW, but Jen when you get home tonight, can you make sure I’ve set up the Practice run correctly?",Low-A
"Great analysis – can you combine the metrics from the webinar attendance and send out to MSS team? (Also, list from Tuesday’s webinar?)",Low-A
"What about this:  As problems and opportunities become more complex, we need new ideas, perspectives and approaches—whether they come from diversity of thought within a group, or from individuals who can shift and apply their thinking based on the situation, task or problem.   But, how do you understand, measure and leverage the breadth of thinking available in your organization to get the results you need? This practical webinar presented by Ann Herrmann-Nehdi will draw on the latest research, examples, and best practices that demonstrate the powerful connection between thinking and business outcomes.",Low-A
"Yes, right now we have it set as Hubspot because the marketing team needed to manage it for creating the lists. My sense is that after the migration, we can  switch it back to NS because it’s easier for the Ams to manage going fwd.",Low-A
I still think it would help us allay Virlina's concerns and include that field In Our report.,Low-A
"Love this newsletter! The opening article is great! Just FYI, please check the status of the Cert on the website before it gets in the newsletter. The NYC in March has been closed for a while.",Low-A
Fabulous news! We’re well on our way to a well-oiled Smarketing team!,Low-A
"So for Beta, until June 30, ppl can get access to Team Dashboard and unlimited pairs and teams via Axon.   Do we want to put this into an Axon communication to entice ppl over? Any reason we shouldn’t?   The form on the website will send a notification to me and Yosuke that they would like to beta the product.",Low-A
"that’s fine. Can you take out mentions of “dinner”? It’s just a Reception with apps.   Add the reception date and time and location to the meeting, and that we have space for 40.",Low-A
"Youske, we need ppl to vote for our book. Can you promote on social and send out tweets/posts that our staff can use?   Closes May 11… we just missed our newsletter!",Low-A
"If you could just put the goal metrics beside the actual metrics, that would help solidify this. Though this report is good, it was not exactly what we needed as a comparison document between what you said you would achieve vs actual. It just states the before and after.  This is very late to be requesting this (most companies I’ve worked at have an expiration date on when bonuses are available). I’ll need to review with Leslie and Dominic to see if we can make an exception. We still do have a cashflow issue, so it may be that we won’t be able to provide a bonus given our company’s overall performance last year.",Low-A
"You can be POC, but CC me",Low-A
"Thanks Yosuke, can you hold until after the MSS mtg – we’ll want feedback from Sales about who should get these invites.",Low-A
"Steve, Yosuke, we have some other design needs around Ann’s materials during her session.  Yosuke, can you pare down some of our collateral wishlist so Steve doesn’t kill himself producing all this stuff?  Also, we should use Clarks for production because they are our preferred partner.",Low-A
Pls cc Ashley on everything about ATD reception.  Keep 7:30 as time.,Low-A
"Interesting.. Yosuke, what’s up with that? ",Low-A
"I don’t have administrative access to the design review space, but I can get it from Karim if need by. Is this something that needs to happen this week?",Low-B
"Can I also get the following images extracted out of your mockup  1. The circle with the arrow pointing right. 2. The background with people milling around from page 3  And what font is the Herrmann International logo on the left written in? Is it a web font that I can use, or should I just treat it as an image? If it’s the second, can I get that image extracted, but without the “ThinkerHub” part, since this is just for the error pages that will apply across the whole site.",Low-B
That sounds good. I can do some technical research in parallel if you can send over the list of product names or links on their website to the specific features we are using.,Low-B
"I’ll probably need a little more clarity on exactly which hubspot products w’ere using and where any technical documentation for them are. I started to browse their website, but it looks like they’ve got a lot going on, and I couldn’t figure out which specific items we’d use with regards to Axon integration.  I assume when you refer to forms, you’re referring to forms for data that has no operational impact on Axon, and so we have no need to store the form data in the Axon database. If you’re referring to any forms where Axon makes use of that data as well, it’s a tricky proposition, and probably requires a more in depth conversation about what data you want, and how you plan to utilize it.",Low-B
"I won¹t be able to get back to the office today, so I¹ll take a look Wednesday.   The file you sent had some formatting issues with it, so I may try to incorporate your changes into the other file.",Low-B
"I talked through this more with bowman, and he's pretty sure we have the  latest. He says the progress tracking code was something where you told him  exactly what to add. Here is the exact code in the .fla file  onClipEvent(load) { function do_nav_op() { _root.get_next(); complet=completare; pag_ina=pagina; loadVariablesNum (""""http://htms.hbdi.com/e-learning/completion.php"""", 0,  """"POST""""); } }  I'm not clear how this actually works since I don't see where completare and  pagina come from, but I don't really know flash. I also don't understand how  those two variables get passed along to the completion.php endpoint.  However, I don't really know flash, so maybe this is correct. Can you  confirm?",Low-B
I just tried it and it still doesn¹t seem like completion data is working. I clicked through all of the screens in a brand new browser session and I don¹t see any changes to the results.,Low-B
Alright the files are in Graphics >> HBDI_Flash_Original >> assets.zip,Low-B
Can I temporarily get write access to that folder. That seems like a good place to upload those assets as any.,Low-B
They’re also in source control for the HTML5 version of the TA. They aren’t named very intuitively though (i.e. Screen2-9.mp4). I can copy those files somewhere else if need be. Where would you like them?,Low-B
"You and I should probably touch base to ensure you’re looking at the latest codebase, since we had to make some minor modifications to incorporate into the axon application. Just give me a call when convenient.",Low-B
"Yes this is separate from the on-going Hurix work, thought this is something they also did. I’m not sure if from a contractual perspective they were linked, or anything like that.  One thing to note, is that most of the issues are tied to video files and their behavior. The muffled audio is only appearing on screens where the audio is part of a video track and the audio that is playing when the application is supposed to be muted, is that same audio. I’m not sure how these video files were generated/extracted from the flash, but that may be part of the issue.",Low-B
How does the current flash version handle long names. Do you know?,Low-B
"That does sound reasonable to me. We might want to test on IE 9 too, since that’s our lowest targeted browser these days I think. https://www.modern.ie/en-us is good for that, they have VMs with every major version of IE so you can try older versions.",Low-B
"Yeah I think so.  They’re trying to talk to the web services on hbdi.biz, but they can’t because it’s a cross site origin request. They want to put the website code on hbdi.biz so they can test the web service interaction. This kind of gets at the issues we talked about though where we don’t really want them to go down this path or get access to hbdi.biz because we’re going to target axon anyways.",Low-B
That’s fine unless you have another suggestion.,Low-B
"Unfortunately, next week is pretty bad for me. I’m in cert Monday – Wed. We can’t win huh?  Are you coming in for the HAT meeting? Maybe we can just connect then.",Low-B

"I have a call at 2:00pm tomorrow, so I pushed this up a little bit, let me know if that’s a problem.",Low-B
"With the weather tomorrow, we may want to put this off until Tuesday. Same time then?  As for location, one of the other coders I know here said that the Enka campus at AB Tech actually has some space open to the public that he likes to use. It’s in one of the buildings at their BASE facility http://www.abtech.edu/base. I am still trying to get clear one which one, but does that sound like a good idea to you? It seems like it might be a better fit for digging in than a coffee shop.",Low-B
"Monday sounds great. Were you thinking we do a working code session, to dig into what’s already there, or do you have another format in mind?   I’m pretty much free all day.",Low-B
"No problem, thanks for letting me know.",Low-B
I still haven’t gotten a login link,Low-B
I haven’t received a Zenefit login yet. I didn’t attend yesterday though and was planning to attend today. Should I have received one even if I haven’t attended yet?,Low-B
I have a 401K from an old employer I’d like to rollover into Herrmann’s plan. Can you provide me with the necessary paperwork to make that happen? Thanks.,Low-B
"Ultimately, as Axon does more and more, we’ll probably run into that issue eventually. What we probably have to do long term with that kind of data is have Axon continue to serve the actual form, but have it push some of the data into Hubspot via an API in the background. That way Axon can continue to track and manage the data it needs to operate, but relevant activity data is duplicated, formatted, and pushed into the space where it can be relevant to you and your team.",Low-B

Excited to join. I’ll do my best not to put everyone to sleep!,Low-B
"Curious to know, was this session recorded?",Low-B
"As Karim alluded to, the publication process is an arduous journey -- it may take a year or two before it officially ends up in press after submitting, depending on the journal.  However, I agree with Karim that we can write a summary paper of sorts or we can write white papers, blog posts, etc. that reference the paper and the findings therein as long as we cite the paper and its authors as an article ""in progress.""  Let me know if I can help in any way.",Low-B
"I think the point about customisation is an important one. They are currently working on their on boarding process – one idea is to use this certification as a working session where the activities contribute to the creation of a Whole Brain onboarding approach (and hopefully, by extension, the HBDI becomes an integral part). If possible I would like to be involved in any discussion with the client that pertains to the customisation…",Low-B
I think we're fine to proceed – glad we’ve finally gotten something arranged. Thanks for your efforts to get this put together!,Low-B
"All they could tell me is that they were trying for late March, but that they didn’t think it was going to be feasible as they are apparently getting together in late February and it would be difficult to get everyone together again so soon. Why they didn’t just use the time in February, I don’t know…  They asked me to put together some info about how our tools are used in on-boarding situations, so I’m going to prepare that and hopefully get an audience with Nina in the next few weeks to discuss. I’ll try to use that opportunity to nail down the cert as well…  Thanks!",Low-B
"Thanks for making some time for us to meet today!  I am available 1pm, and Orin is trying to rearrange his diary so that he might join as well. Shall we plan to meet you at the Hammersmith offices?",Low-B
"Hi, yes we would be very happy to meet up with Novie on Friday! Alternatively we could do it first thing (maybe 830am or latest 9am) tomorrow or Thursday, as the exhibition doesn’t start until 10am and is very close to Coke’s Hammersmith offices (assuming that is where they are based?).",Low-B
"In preparation for the meeting, we’d once again like to have everyone meet for small group discussions. This time around, we’d like to ask everyone to select one of the Fundamentals that you are going to commit to focusing on between now and the next HAT meeting. In your groups, we’d like for you to discuss some of the steps you’ll be taking to develop on this Fundamental, getting feedback and input from your group mates. As an output of the discussion, we’d like for each group to submit one slide outlining which Fundamental each of you will be focusing on, with some explanation of why and how you’ll do so.   To make things interesting, the Fundamental you choose will be your entry into a lotto-style drawing for a $250 Amazon gift card. One Fundamental will be chosen at random, and the prize will be split among everyone who chose that particular Fundamental as a focus – so choose wisely!",Low-B
"In addition to reviewing the Fundamentals, our agenda will be to cover:  * New team member introductions * Shout-outs and team mate of the quarter  As per usual, departmental WIG updates will be sent as pre-reading in advance of the meeting, and we can also spend any time needed addressing questions.",Low-B
"So, I’d like to ask that in the next few days you quickly install the latest build of the app on your own Apple or Android device(s) and give it a test run. I know that there have been client questions about some of these bugs, so we want to get this done as quickly as possible! Assuming that this final batch of testing goes well, we hope to submit the latest version to the app stores early next week.",Low-B
"Please join me in welcoming Naomi Morton to the Herrmann team!  Naomi is joining the Global Innovation team as Product Development Manager, based in London – her first day was actually last Monday, but she was in Cert all week so I figured I would wait until today to introduce her. Attached is her HBDI® profile, for everyone’s reference (don’t worry, she authorised my sending it along!)  Below is a quick intro that Naomi prepared, along with a photo – please take a moment to introduce yourself to her (ideally via Slack :) when you have a chance. We’re very excited to have her on board!",Low-B
"Now, we'd like for you to come back to these commitments to evaluate your progress. If you haven't already, meet with your group mates, and share what you've done over the past few months to focus on your Fundamental. What has worked? What hasn't? Be honest with yourself and your group mates, and ask for feedback on how you're doing.  For the meeting, we'd like for each team to come prepared with what insights and lessons they've taken away from their combined efforts to adopt the values and behaviors we subscribe to at Herrmann. Whether from your own experiences or those of your peers, we're hoping that we can all learn from one another as we endeavor to build a great company and great careers. So, please come prepared to share in whatever format you think best represents your group. Be creative! We can't wait to see what you've done.",Low-B
"Oh well, I did it all. The online signatures are tough!",Low-B
"Happy to do this but is it really relevant for me? I’m not a US employee and Ann doesn’t track my PTO so if it costs us more for me to have a seat, I’d just as soon be rid of it.",Low-B
Ha I just got an email and started worrying it was spam – thanks for notifying!,Low-B
"We are starting peer review now, so it probably won’t make its way into an academic journal for a while. But that doesn’t stop us from creating an executive summary type of document that can be used for sales & marketing purposes",Low-B
"I’ll see what I can pull together.  In the meantime, the Cognitive Diversity metrics we've used in the INSEAD research (latest version attached) can and should make their way into our DoT toolkit. I’ll leave it to your marketing mastery to come up with great branded names for them…",Low-B
"I need to head to bed as I have an early pitch to Balfour Beatty tomorrow morning. Christina, can you please give Dominic an update on the TA mockups?",Low-B
"Some edits in line below. I think we hold off on showing examples until we share the feedback? Otherwise I would want to put together a more comprehensive overview of the new branding elements, drawing from the materials that 3c provided as outputs from the last phase.  Thanks!",Low-B
Just a reminder that each team will need to send their updated recommendations to Jennifer by this Wednesday! Your input will be important for the LT as we make progress on our plans for 2016. Please make sure you’ve had a chance to get back together as a team to reflect on the HAT meeting discussions and finalize your recommended actions.  Please also complete the survey if you haven’t already!,Low-B
Wait I’m confused – didn’t your last email say you weren’t available to meet today? Just let me know as I was planning to reschedule some meetings this afternoon so we could get a few hours together…,Low-B
"I think it would be better if you could join Dominic – there’s no urgency around this date, so we can reschedule to next week",Low-B
"Just to clarify, there was not an expectation that your groups would create slides for the HAT meeting activities – if you have, you can send them over to me for inclusion in the presentation, but if you haven’t please just plan to speak up on the call tomorrow!",Low-B
"Just a quick reminder to please submit your votes for the 2016 rallying cry by end of day…  Thanks, and have a great weekend!",Low-B
"As you probably saw, I’ve responded to him. If you aren’t available to meet in person today then let’s plan to get together in person next week as I’m driving up to NY tomorrow and will most likely need to stay until Monday to deliver a session for a UK client up there.",Low-B
We all agree with you. Unfortunately due to a communication error an early working draft of a design concept was used. This will not be the Brain Bytes header moving forward.  We’ll certainly be in touch as / when appropriate.,Low-B
"To provide a bit more context on the date change for the upcoming HAT meeting: a number of team members were not available on the original date, so we’ve decided to reschedule in hopes of getting maximum participation across the company. During the meeting, the Leadership Team will be sharing the outcomes of our recent strategy meetings, as well as the actions we will be taking as a company in response to the development recommendations that were shared in the November HAT meeting.  We’ll be providing a more detailed agenda, as well as the departmental pre-readings, next week.",Low-B
"Just as a reminder, for today’s session please come prepared to present the standard agenda outputs (the three points below) as well as your reflections on 2015 – what went well, and how we can improve in 2016.  Thanks and looking forward to our discussion!",Low-B
Received. I will review and let you know if I have questions,Low-B
Can we meet today instead of tomorrow? Am free for the rest of the afternoon.,Low-B
"Further to our discussion today, you should now have alternating meetings on your calendars for Thursdays, replacing our current team WIG meetings – a 2 hour Sprint review meeting aligned to the current Axon sprint schedule, the first of which will be next Thursday 17 Dec, and a shorter stand-up meeting on the off week, the first of which will be 7 Jan.  Sorry about the multiple invitations I sent around – should all be done now, but please let me know if you have any questions about this.  Also I neglected to mention on today’s call that I will be Out of Office Thursday and Friday of this week, and Monday of next week, so please reschedule any of our recurring meetings we have booked for those days if they are needed.",Low-B
"I agree that this doesn’t give the most professional feel. I don’t mind the thought bubbles (although the thumbs up is hard to decipher, and the piggy bank could be tightened up a bit) but the hand-drawn graphics on page 2, 3 and 8 don’t fit and look unrefined. Christina, I assume that this is still in mockup stages? For final version we can move a bit closer to the vector+ink hybrids we have been discussing for the TA… Betsy an example attached for your reference, or otherwise: http://keepearthquakesweird.com/grid",Low-B
1130 your time / 430 mine?,Low-B
Um I’m pretty sure I just changed it? Please check and confirm,Low-B
"TO BE CLEAR – Bowman doesn’t work for Herrmann any more, and has proven himself flaky. Let’s not rely on him.",Low-B
Fixed,Low-B
Just a reminder that each team will need to send their updated recommendations to Jennifer by this Wednesday! Your input will be important for the LT as we make progress on our plans for 2016. Please make sure you’ve had a chance to get back together as a team to reflect on the HAT meeting discussions and finalize your recommended actions.  Please also complete the survey if you haven’t already!,Low-B
"I’ve also just checked the form online, and there shouldn’t be an issue on that side of things. I would suggest that we check the situation with the service email account before re-doing all of the forms on the WIX site.",Low-B
"End of Q1 at the earliest, and no – I don’t think there are are e-debriefed per se – just that that they have abridged reports that they sell.",Low-B
Virlina and I have the survey results and will be sharing them soon. We’re just working to assess the estimated workload for each so that we can prioritise according to both impact and feasibility.,Low-B
"Just to be clear - will we switch presenters (i.e., the slides will be piped through my computer) or will I just be clicking through your slides? If the latter, how will we add in the slide with the analysis of Richard’s opening remarks?",Low-B
"Attached are the updated product slides.  A few notes:  I’ve added in Christina’s new mockups where possible. These is still one phone in the mockups because I can’t remove it, but hopefully that’s not a big deal.  I rearranged the slides a little bit for better flow and added animations etc. throughout.  I added in the analysis of a sample agent script. Obviously the first slide, which will be used for the analysis of Richard’s presentation, will be updated live during the presentation.",Low-B
"I need to head to bed as I have an early pitch to Balfour Beatty tomorrow morning. Christina, can you please give Dominic an update on the TA mockups?",Low-B
How’re we doing with the new mockups? I’d like to replace some of the phone mockups with iPad mockups if we can. Would need as many as possible before Tuesday,Low-B
"Some edits in line below. I think we hold off on showing examples until we share the feedback? Otherwise I would want to put together a more comprehensive overview of the new branding elements, drawing from the materials that 3c provided as outputs from the last phase.  Thanks!",Low-B
No reason everyone shouldn’t have a say!,Low-B
No opposition here,Low-B
"A Skype call sometime this week sounds great. I’m actually stateside at the moment with our lead designer, Christina Kaputsos, who is copied as I’d like to have her join the call.   Would Thursday 7:30pm US / Friday 7:30am Singapore work for both of you?",Low-B
We weren’t actually looking for a paid space – just access to one of their free lounges?,Low-B
Can you please take a look at the product column in the attached and confirm Bowman’s time spent on things like the Nordisk and IBM portals?,Low-B
"Thanks Betsy. Unfortunately some of these things are limitations of the platform – e.g., 2-sided layout, “Check Answer” etc. can’t be changed. Best we can do is try to make our content as engaging (and typographically accurate) as possible…",Low-B
"Christina and I are heads down for the next few days and have limited time together, so I need her focused on the TA. If these are changes that can be made quickly, I’m OK with it being done now (I.e., in the next hour tops), but since the Practitioner Hub is not an essential component of the Cert experience yet, if it cannot be completed quickly I would rather us just not use the Hub yet OR find a way to take these changes off of Christina’s plate.  Also, is the plan to customize this page for each and every Cert? Doesn’t that create ripple effects for the other people using the same page?",Low-B
Thanks for adding me to the list Larry.  I have the guide from May but didn’t know if it had been updated for new features.  Christina and I can do a demo call sometime next Mon-Wed if that would work for you?,Low-B
No response?,Low-B
I think we need to set up a Sales demo login – I’ll reach out to Larry to get those set up,Low-B
I did it already… just wanted you to be in the loop :),Low-B
"I wanted to share a response to more and more frequent client question about the left / right controversy, so that everyone on our team is clear on where we stand with regards to this point and has some material to address the question in case it comes up in one of your conversations.  Please let me know if you have any questions!",Low-B
Wonderful work Sarah!,Low-B
"In the spirit of One Herrmann, I would prefer that we just consolidate the sites (and establish a permanent mirroring) and have events, team, etc. listed for both locations",Low-B
"Thanks Betsy, I concur with this from the product side – Christina should make the decision about which platform makes most sense from the design and accessibility perspectives.",Low-B
"Congrats! Great work, Coca Cola is a tremendous opportunity for us globally and this is just the type of momentum we need!",Low-B
"Agree – not sure where we stand with that project, so if there’s still a lot to be done let’s not let it become a bottleneck",Low-B
"I think this should work well. My only request is that you get Christina involved in the portal redesign, as she has already been working on the IBM portal and it would be good to keep those consistent.",Low-B
If easier I have a version of the Creative Brain cover art without a background (attached)… Might save Bowman some photoshopping time.,Low-B
"Looks better IMO.  You could break up the Kouzes quote into two pieces? Breaking point before This book is rich in…""",Low-B
This makes Hilton stays much more appealing as I get free internet!,Low-B
This means he might get selected and I may not—only one of us can be selected.    Is that what we want to do?,Low-B
Also the pictures and Ned and Ann appear a bit grainy?,Low-B
"Finally Crystal Snoddy is from InterContinental Hotels Group…""",Low-B
I haven’t heard back from you about this and really need an update. Can you please provide it to me ASAP.,Low-B
This would be awesome in so many ways. I love the work they’ve done around defining a company culture and it would be great to be a part of that!,Low-B
"Dynamic camera work would be great, yes – so that we could re-use parts of the footage for Jubi, the practitioners’ corner or otherwise. I wouldn’t worry about capturing the screen too much as that is something we can overlay later…",Low-B
Hi – I think we should try to get them to attend our upcoming UK Cert (Feb 24–26)? We’re still trying to fill the seats… Virlina do you want to reach out?,Low-B
"Just to clarify, there was not an expectation that your groups would create slides for the HAT meeting activities – if you have, you can send them over to me for inclusion in the presentation, but if you haven’t please just plan to speak up on the call tomorrow!",Low-B
No problem. I made sure to assign you to the biggest improvement opportunity :)  I know we still need to catch up on Coke – would Thurs work for you?,Low-B
This week is brutal for me – could we find some time next week?,Low-B
Great! I should be able to get there by 3 or so. Looking forward to it!,Low-B
"No worries Jeff, I’ll be sending out a recap shortly",Low-B
"Hi Jeff – no problem. For your reference, we’re going to need at least an hour if we are going to cover both of the topics below (typically those are one hour each!)",Low-B
"We didn’t find them, as far as I’m aware!",Low-B
"All they could tell me is that they were trying for late March, but that they didn’t think it was going to be feasible as they are apparently getting together in late February and it would be difficult to get everyone together again so soon. Why they didn’t just use the time in February, I don’t know…  They asked me to put together some info about how our tools are used in on-boarding situations, so I’m going to prepare that and hopefully get an audience with Nina in the next few weeks to discuss.

"Thanks - yes, have been there many times :)  Will let you know if I am able to make any headway with scheduling Cert...  Have a great weekend!",Low-B
"Thanks for making some time for us to meet today!  I am available 1pm, and Orin is trying to rearrange his diary so that he might join as well. Shall we plan to meet you at the Hammersmith offices?",Low-B
"That’s fine for me, thanks very much! I have your address and will shoot a quick note when I’m on my way down",Low-B
"Just landed back into London – it feels great to be back.  Tomorrow morning is great, if that still works for you. Looking forward to it!",Low-B
"OK, went through the signup process, will forward along anything I receive",Low-B
"Fascinating test of recognition of emotions—related to empathy. The included Linked story on reading fiction for building those skills is also fascinating! Try the test—see what score you get. I suggest going with your first instinct. Mine was always right. When I doubted it and tried to analyze, I chose another and it was wrong. Data also shows that the analytical processes neutralize our empathy systems ..a great example!",Low-B
Great! Let me know…,Low-B
Saturday am sounds great-and love to see the family as well!   Where and when works best for you? Ireland is amazing.. So beautiful ..,Low-B
Looks like Monday is out—have to be in Paris. So it looks like Friday is the only option for a meeting/lunch with Victoria—or Saturday with you Sue but do not expect a weekend meeting unless you see the value : )  Let me know!,Low-B
"Betsy- Attached are my notes.   I like him as an artist and I like his work. He seems to have great skills and passion and interest. Great!  I know you are anxious to hire right away- AND I think we need to follow a process in our hires.   With years of experience, I believe strongly in the adage, hire slow, fire fast, so please understand that context and bear with me on making sure you follow a process that allows us to ensure fit and a great hire.  You do not want to find yourself  having waited all this time for a hire and having it not work out.   Domain skills are not usually what get in the way of effectiveness. I was looking for how well he would be working, collaborating, culture fit etc. as you and I had discussed.",Low-B
"Portal 1 We want to require the e mail  so we can track who is accessing the TA. The way we are set up pre axon, we cannot give people an individual access code just for THEM,. This way we can monitor who is accessing the TA (in case they pass it around their company) and can intervene.   Portal 2 I think we WANT to require e mail addresses for any download of decks, even abbreviated.  Does that clarify it?  Thanks so much for this under such a short time frame. I learned of this handout complexity this morning while talking to the sponsor.  We can learn from this for the next event. More and more speaking events will be of this type and have this type of situation- Linda now knows to get you involved early on for anything marketing related.  Thank you!!!!",Low-B
Assume you get these..?,Low-B
We asked him to make changes and he did not. We did send him a request! Wonder if it got lost!  We heard from him July 3rd with a  draft and with IP dept. transition had not replied yet. We will let him know immediately as we had requested these changes. We can hold off putting it on the website until the changes are made if we prefer and can let him know that.,Low-B
Bev is asking when I will be at the booth—can you copy her too?,Low-B
BTW—promise to share what I learn  :),Low-B
Can you send this to spam for me? Password issues.,Low-B
Curtis—I saw you on the webinar today! Thanks for attending…I know you know all of this stuff : )  Love the article (pages 16-17) and thanks for the plug! I could have plugged it had I known you were doing it ( both at Training 2016 and today) !  Thanks for sharing—we will reference it on our website etc…  Safe travels and stay in touch.,Low-B
Darn—I missed the 10/9 deadline! When do you need them tonight? I have not even started on this. Other materials are OK.,Low-B
Did he know you were planning to send this out in advance and that his draft was final? It may be very awkward at this point to “remove” people from the end of the day…,Low-B
"Here are our edits! BTW we already had a client look up the book on Amazon- we may want to update some of that copy too at some point. Let me know if you have any questions. FYI, we have caught up on the editing revisions and will have the last bits to Pattie by EOB. All chapters are in. Yeah!",Low-B
"In the spirit of consistency, I thought we might add a cartoon to the contact page if you think there is room. If so let me know and I will find one that fits : )  Thanks and have a great weekend.",Low-B
"Is there any way to include Jim Kouzes full quote (or a longer version) on the praise page as well? I think if we do that he would not have an issue.  I was pretty pleased with what he wrote! I was not sure who would have the greatest name recognition and what sells more books- you are the expert on that.   What will appeal most to the target reader?  Is Loftis represent enough appeal to the “business reader”? Not sure we have a better one -I do like her quote!  Mark Schar’s credentials are:  Dr. Mark Schar  Senior Researcher and Lecturer, School of Engineering   Center for Design Research, Stanford University  FYI  Also:   Former Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Intuit, Inc.  The only other current option is the MIT quote which would need to be shortened.",Low-B
From our accounting firm- beware!,Low-B
Sorry so many typos!! I meant see if you can commit to the development of a bonus plan by April 1st in the offer letter-does that seem legit Shanna? If needed we could say variable bonus of up to 10k to be spelled out in a plan developed by ___ date or something like that?,Low-B
Here is what she sent. Pretty close. I told her at the end of the call ( did not warn her ) to recap what she heard.,Low-B
"Just a quick question…is there anything that would have changed your mind about the decision you made? I think Betsy thinks she could have “resolved” it if only she had talked with you, based on her conversation with you Friday. I am just curious.",Low-B
Not sure if the content is useful—most comprehensive list we have I believe.,Low-B
Nice note from Lei…,Low-B
Rough draft…probably some gaps and overlaps…hope this helps. Not sure of %’s – events may be 15 and research 25…let me know how it goes!,Low-B
"I wrote you ( see below) asking if you could show me how to set this up in Axon ( I know last week was crazy). I now need to get this done tomorrow. Can you help me make that happen? Note- I will want to have them use the team dashboard as well, - they will complete it right before my debrief after my session on Jan 21. If best, we can send them both at the same time. I would like to insist everyone do a NEW HBDI for this session so they are all in AXON. They will also need to be able to download and access the app will do another session Jan 22.  If anyone has not been debriefed before I will handle it vs using the TA.",Low-B
Oh my-does that mean she now has to double up her payments to pay them back? UHG! Did that happen to anyone else?,Low-B
"I hope you had a fantastic Thanksgiving and are recovering from all that great food!  I wanted to update you on some issues we have had , since the very beginning, with Digital Benefits. I am told that you recommended them and asked that we work only with them, so I thought you might want to know about this change. This year has been a nightmare  with them. In spite of the issues we had ( screwed up enrollment for many employees, cancellation scare notice sent out to all mid year, missing employee cards, late enrollements for new employees and on and on) we asked Digital for renewal info for 2016 earlier this fall. We did not hear back from them and had to constantly chase them for info- and did nto get anything in time to do the renewal. We had to cancel our planned employee enrollment information meetings since they would not move faster—they always complained it was the insurance co’s problem (they had recommended that company!)",Low-B
"I am excited to announce that Ann Maxey will be joining the organization as HR Manager / Executive Assistant on Monday October 10, 2016. This new full time role provides Herrmann with the HR know-how that will help us grow and develop, as well as Executive support and meeting planning.    Ann and her husband, Mark (a FireMedic) live in Tampa, Florida. Together they have two daughters. Brianna, 18, a Freshman at University of Central Florida and Sabrina, 15, a Freshman at Gaither High School. She enjoys cooking, sewing, travel, and crafts. In her spare time she teaches Sunday School and is actively involved in community efforts/activities related to Feeding the Homeless and End 68 Hours of Hunger.

"Jen, we need to schedule time to talk about how to best work together. I'm not feeling 100% to care about how I will stay on top of everything with this new plan. I have a feeling things are slipping through the cracks which makes me very nervous. Perhaps you can send a List of outstanding items that I need to be working on with the timeline over the next few weeks. I know we need to try to find reasonable lodging in Nashville for the lead events and decide if I should drive or fly depending on costs also we have decided to have our February leadership meeting in Tampa and want to make sure that we have a reasonable way to manage that meeting I actually thought perhaps that getting an Airbnb house with meeting space in the dining room or something which may be more reasonable than a Regis.",Low-B
Can you read the full e mail trail below and give me some insight?,Low-B
Val and JT Live there so we should probably be in a location that allows them to easily drive to the meeting Leslie will fly down so if we have a big house where Leslie can seem me and Dominic can stay that's great or we need a reasonable hotel situation but we probably need to get on the flight really soon and I will need a ride to Tampa from Orlando if JT or Val plan to be there. Can you get started on looking at some options there?,Low-B
FYI--- not passed yet but possibly may have changes that could affect us. Stay tuned…,Low-B
"FYI— During my 121 with Jennifer, a good question, came up. We wondered if there was a budget for unpaid speaking engagements? Betsy let us know below that there is not (aside from ATD and training I suppose)- but perhaps she is not taking into account the handouts and my travel- not sure. It appears that there is not a budget for the unpaid speaking engagements I am doing? That could be a problem as the expenses I incur, if not reimbursed, would come out of nowhere and not line up with the budget. Maybe we need a thought leadership budget that Jen and I manage?",Low-B
Looking forward to the summit. Can you please remind me of the specific format David uses in his breakout sessions like the one I am doing on technology? We discussed the topic but I overlooked asking him about the format. I seem to recall from previous summits that the format is often that each panelist speaks for a short amount of time (if so how long?) o and then there is group discussion. (I also seem to recall a Q&A format in some sessions) or does it work differently than wither of those? If so what is the format? I also seem to recall that I can use visuals if needed. Please advise as I am working this week to finalize everything.,Low-B
Go ahead and book. Sorry if that was not clear.,Low-B
"Good—I was hoping you would be ok with it. Since I have worked with her for so long, I wanted her to hear the context from me so you two could focus on the future : )",Low-B
Great ! Thanks for letting me know. I spoke with Marla last night and let her know- so you could be speaking opening together. She feels this will accelerate the writing and decision making process. She said she struggles with the re writes with Mark—needing so much detail at the outline phase that she ending up writing it then. I will try and make sure we avoid that—it is not happening with the book so she and I may have a faster sign off process. I was unaware that was happening behind the scenes with Mark.  She seems in a good place! You have managed that relationship well!,Low-B
Great news! Wonderful application and terrific revenue per thinker.,Low-B
Here it is-I may have changed a few minor things.,Low-B
"I caught something in the draft that is a detail but one I think our CP’s might wonder about. See the modification below. It looked like we were putting “leaders” as primarily A quad thinkers because of the phrasing, and there is a weird punctuation after the word better in the following paragraph ( in the original ( attached):  Diversity and inclusion are at the heart of our entire business. It¹s what Whole Brain® Thinking is all about. Being able to tap into the full range of different perspectives, ideas and backgrounds is what makes us better, more effective leaders. As we all focus on our goals, implement, collaborate and innovate, we depend on the synergy that diversity brings us as a team and as partners working with diverse clients, organizations and thinkers around the world.",Low-B
See attached for my proposal—once I get the art I can have Nehdi mock this to scale—do we have those exact dimensions? Will need it to finish.  Please comment if you prefer with ABCD or not. Kevin the creativity model in BOT was WAY too much info so I simplified the PS walkaround. Does it work?,Low-B

"I just learned we will be working together for the meeting next week on the “one thing” ( see page 6 of the attached)  we will each do to help us achieve our objectives. We need to be prepared to present that to the rest of the company on Day 1. I am hoping we can find a time to talk! Since many of you will be travelling Monday, I think tomorrow Friday the 18th is all we have : )  I can do ( all EDT)  8 am  1 pm 4 pm  1 pm is friendlier for Jeff. Will that work for everyone? If not then let’s try for 4 pm. 8 am will be our fall back. Please let me know what might work!",Low-B
"Ok—the form is new, isn’t it Jen? I understood there was no form.",Low-B
"Your stuff really works—you really help ind, teams and org be better thinkers, better message, better ideate—everybody does diversity, “innovation” this really does not differentiate you as the thinking company with 35 years of research and stuff that really works, not fluff….should describe the actual “work’ we do as best we can, not lofty consulting terms read off like a laundry list. You do not really say what you do—you just say you do this and this and this. That combined with the flashing video just exhausts me and I walk away not clear that you will help me adapt and thrive and certainly not know how you will.",Low-B
Ok—sorry to hear that…hang in there.,Low-B
Perfect! If we have already explained proformas earlier that does the trick!  Many thanks for the quick response…,Low-B
Progress is always terrific!  Go team!,Low-B
Sounds good—I think the deck will be helpful as a resource if questions come up along the way : )  Mya need to go on route 40 – so reception may be tricky. Hard to judge which roads are best.  Are you ok if the call doesn’t happen? Will try but no guarantee. I may opt for 26 via Hendersonville. You used to do this commute—have an opinion?,Low-B
"Out of the 12, 10 mentioned that the Fortune 9 out of 10 was the wrong thing to bring up—(we also got this feedback from the advisory board). Why? It says that those companies which are not perceived as progressive or edgy, are doing this so why would I want to do this for my company since they are all perceived as “noisy” companies, not cutting edge etc.  The only other comment was that ‘if I work for one of those companies then we are probably already using this stuff’  …I wanted to see how you could actually help..what solutions do you actually have for this problem(second half)..I got the message in the beginning—those quotes really got me, drop the 9 out of 10 and get to how WB helps solve the problem versus telling me we do this and that",Low-B
It was great seeing everyone in action last week during our service day. See below the thank you from Julia at Asheville City Schools!  We do make a difference!,Low-B
"Also, please provide your feedback today if possible so I can review it later. We will live with this model for a while so I want to get it right. Reminder- the whole brain business book chapter refers t this as a general model- not specific to CEO’s, which is fine and it can become the basis of our leadership agility program.  Many thanks for your help!",Low-B
"FYI see Orin’s response below to my question about who might attend with me.   Jen, do we/Can we get a participant pass as part of this arrangement? We can position them as my support?   Please coordinate this with Orin and let us know.",Low-B
Glad to announce that the HBDI and WBT are in a new McGill University program being offered by HBDI practitioner Robert Parris.    Donna- nicely done!,Low-B
"Hi- with all the changes going on , things are a bit in flux. Seeing the updates in advance is ideal. Would each team member please send out your update to the team by e mail ASAP and no later than EOB today? In light of the shorter meeting, we will need to be super-efficient in our process. Please read these before our meeting tomorrow.  Please send any agenda items you want to make sure we process to Jen by EOB today.",Low-B
"Hoping you are having/had a great Easter weekend!  Jen and Marla, nice job- it looks like we are accepted.  Much time has gone by since we put this on our list. It would be good to clarify our objectives:  *         I assume this is primarily a direct market, healthcare vertical? Do we need a CRM to attend? If so which one? *         Did we plan a booth and if so have we kept that plan or did we cancel it?   *         Size of total audience attending and alignment with our ‘target’ in the direct? *         Number of probable attendees for the 2 sessions combined? *         What would success look like – how many target qualified leads and target cost per lead based on our projected costs? *         Is there any reason why we would NOT accept this? (Do not want to make any assumptions!)  I will need to let them know by Tuesday, so please confirm by then that we want to proceed so Linda can accept on my behalf.",Low-B
I hope this list will help us sort out which goes where for sending to Donya. I added a cartoon for the preface- I think it would be best placed right where I mention cartoons- or in the front if that is not possible. I will respond to Donya with an update. Merry Christmas and thanks so much for all of your help!!! That goes to you too Marla!,Low-B
"I spoke with Deb Stratas at IBM, who designed the TLY ( The Leader in You) program for technical professionals at IBM, that Whole Brain Thinking and the HBDI have been part of for the last several years. She shared with me that after analyzing the ROI of the program ( “powered by WBT/HBDI”), they measured an 8 point increase in engagement and 3 point drop in attrition! Although we cannot take full claim for those results, our part of the program is consistently ranked as the most liked and she confirmed that we are part of the reason why they achieved such stellar level 4 <https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/kirkpatrick.htm>  results. Attached is an internal IBM document reporting their approach that we cannot share externally, but we can share the results with our clients and prospects. Great to see this ROI!",Low-B
In case you ever wonder if our newsletter gets passed on. Scroll down below-Danny is using it to introduce us to his client at Walmart!  Well done!,Low-B
"I thought you would enjoy the article (click or use link below) that resulted from the “lunch and learn” session we did in addition to the paid program on Cognitive Diversity in  Orlando last week (which included participants from Walt Disney, Universal, The Department of Defense, the College of Central Florida, several independents and others.)  Cognitive Diversity is one of the pillars of our point of view focus you learned about at the company meeting in January.  The article describes  the 30 minute lunch and learn session, which the school is using to gain buy in to their Diversity program with students and faculty. We provided this as a way to “give back” to them as a sponsor of the program and hopefully peak some interest in Whole Brain Thinking at the College of Medicine at UCF. As it was a small group, we also offered the HBDI experience as a way to get them intrigued and hopefully started.    Enjoy your weekend!",Low-B
In the spirit of clearer communication and to further clarify my last e-mail and my thinking:  I am glad we made the decision to move NOW. Let’s make sure we watch closely the distraction factor so we do not get caught off guard and lose too much momentum on keeping the business growing while we are looking.,Low-B
Many have asked if the LEAD presentation I did last week was recorded as many missed it or were unable to log on. It was recorded and will be uploaded to youtube- hopefully soon (they had said it would be up by now). I will let your know as soon as it is.,Low-B
"Wow! Great work under duress...I love the new look and feel- clean! Per your request, am sharing a few links/areas to attend to- I know you are still working on it ... The link to our career opportunities on the About Herrmann page just loops back to the main page. also Andrew and Yosuke and ? are missing from the line up (just FYI- may be in progress etc) I submitted a contact form - it refreshes right back to the page- no confirmation appears. On my screen -the send button is just below the box and requires scrolling- that may be easy to move up a bit. On the main page i assumed that I could click on the round icons above each section (Thinking about results etc). I suspect others will too. On What we do-- under govt there is a typo. I can't seem to pull up our current site to see what we had before ( new site is coming up) At least remove ""type of"" if nothing else",Low-B
Ok—really too bad. Nehdi will see if we can change the background.,Low-B
"Thats all for now- happy to review further if that is helpful...""",Low-B
"Team, I am not sure I love any of them but prefer 1 and 2. Do you have a preference?",Low-B
Terrible!,Low-B
Thank you Dorothy…!,Low-B
Thank you for the yummy whole brain card!!!,Low-B
I think the Oris call needs to include Dominic -use Mom's passing as an excuse though Keep linear training-I need time next week too so that will end up washing out.   I have not had a 1-1 with Betsy for weeks-I think I need to keep that too...  Sent from my iPhone,Low-B
"Note—many did not actually attend. I suggest you also send the attendance report that Yosuke can pull to show who attended, asked which question , answered polls etc.",Low-B
Glad this all worked out :)   Jennifer is a great resource!!!,Low-B
Thanks Betsy—actually I will be up at my Mom’s tomorrow waiting on a delivery and most likely can work around your schedule. Why don’t you send me some options and I will see what seems to work best?,Low-B
"Thanks Betsy.  The list sounds complete. My questions:  *         Will everything, including the handout, be in color (except the other side of the card stock)?  *         Will the postcards be similar to the last ones we created? If you can send me the art it will help in my presentation as I refer to them *         Can you please send the attachments?: ) *         I trust they know their attendance so we should be able to produce very close to what we need with very little waste.  *         I trust the comment about ‘we cannot give them everything ‘ and pen/note paper means you will leave the communication model as is?  Thanks!",Low-B
"Wow-Well done! Congrats are in order. I am sure you must be very excited.  In reading through it, I noted a typo in our company description on page 4:  …Many businesses are trying to more with less, (while) with the need to close the gap in knowledge and skills.   Also on page 14: Ann Herrmann-Nehdi   It may be too late to fix—but if you will be distributing PDF’s and can change those I would appreciate it! Thanks and see you at ICE.",Low-B
Thanks for the catch Danny! See corrected version attached.,Low-B
They have now taken this into hand and have reached out : )  BTW my car is telling me that the brake pads are worn out- I have a call into BMW service in A ville for a potential appt Thursday am- based on calendar that seemed to be the easiest. Will let you know when I hear back.,Low-B
Unless you think I need to look at them- I trust your eyes are enough! Thanks for keeping this moving!,Low-B
"I hope all is well! Did Alison ever get the evaluation summary completed? Also, I was wondering about follow up for other HRPS sessions. Is there anything I need to do on my end?  Again many thanks for the support for the session!",Low-B
Hmmm. This is bizarre—suggest a phone call perhaps with them to clarify where the ai files are? If they needed to change them and them move to jpeg for some reason we need to understand why and how to fix these!,Low-B
Here is my biggest concern: His communication style reminded me a lot of  Yosuke. I had a hard time following him in our call (and you know how yellow I am ). I had to repeat questions a few times to get clear answers. I feel like you might need to reel him in. What would you have done differently in the Yosuke hire to make sure he would work well with others and with you?  How would you ‘test’ for that? Can you do that now?  I slept on this last night and really listened to my intuition before writing this. I am sending my notes so you could see how the conversation went ( I took out a lot of the filler stuff that took place).,Low-B
I just reviewed this. Unless I stay up all night—will not get through to 20. Will do as much as I can! And keep you informed.,Low-B
I have a few to add from this week but mostly Q2 opportunities. Traveling to FL next week so should be adding to pipeline.,Low-D
"I’m right there with you. All the more reason why sharing what is and isn’t working in the sales process is critical to our success and growth.   I don’t know about you, but I like to WIN and WIN BIG, why I came to Herrmann and for me (and my big GREEN brain) it’s about streamlining or even creating processes where there aren’t any so we can scale, automate and get stuff going FAST – build up a transactional base and then always have a handful of BIG accounts/deals in the pipeline.",Low-D
Already did that. But she wanted examples of the Templates that are missing. And I told her pretty much all of them.  Can you do me a favor and send me a screen capture from your HS when you are in a contact record and going to send an e-mail and go to the template drop down menu to choose which e-mail to send.  If it isn’t too much trouble!,Low-D
Awesome!!!! Seeing first-hand the impact of HBDI and Whole Brain Thinking with this group was hugely impactful for me.   Thank you Karim for reaching out to this group and letting us be a part of the learning.,Low-D
I have a personal iPad Mini that I can bring if we want to show some of the content on a different form factor? Just a thought.,Low-D
Calling her on her cell so I’ll call you first and then conference her in.,Low-D
Good Morning! The only customer that I have on Axon is Kilpatrick and Stockton and I’d be happy to check with them to see if they would be interested in Beta testing the new Digital Profile Pack.,Low-D
Hello Jeff! Sorry I had to throw you into voice mail :( I have a call in 10 minutes with Ashely that shouldn’t take too long (to wrap up a proposal) and then I can call you..so around 11:45ish EST.,Low-D
"Okay. I was just e-mailing you. I'm on there but have a message that says: ""waiting for the presenter.""",Low-D
Here you go! I'm at an early lunch meeting with Cox right now bout call me after 1 EST if you have questions.,Low-D
Hi Jeff. I just called you back but got your voice mail. I was another call and couldn’t click over fast enough. Just call me back when you are free.,Low-D
I concur. Just let us know what we ultimately decide.,Low-D
"I have a ShoutOut for Toni :) While Bethany was out on medical leave, she was a huge help in getting things done internally and even getting on the phone with me and a few customers!  My next one would be for the AM and CRM team collectively, including Ashley and having some really productive and insightful calls over the last few months on all things sales..what’s working, what’s not working in our sales efforts for prospecting and lead generation; best practices from other customers that we’ve been able to share; positioning our various products and services within an organization….the list is long!  Hope you are having a good trip. Travel safely back to the UK :)",Low-D
"I second that!! It is exhausting, and not a good of time for me to have to make request to my AM to look up this kind of information and then wait for a response. If we can move some of the NetSuite data into HubSpot for “view only” then I’d like to understand what the hold up is?",Low-D
"If you find it, can you please share with all? Most of my e-mails on DPP have been “one-offs” after I’ve had a conversation with a customer so mine are pretty specific.",Low-D
"Do you want to join me at 2 pm EST for a call with Hearst Autos? Miranda is attending certification in October here in Atlanta and came from Cox Automotive (one of our biggest customers: Autotrader, Manheim etc. to name a few of the companies under the Cox umbrella).",Low-D
"Please go ahead and follow up on this one as the e-mail address is cox.net which tells me this is an individual that is simply an “end-user” of Cox Media’s internet services and not a Cox Automotive employee, which would be CoxAuto.com or one of their other companies like DealerTrack, Manheim or AutoTrader.   If it turns out they are affiliated with Cox, then please let me know.  Happy Selling!",Low-D
"Just a head’s up on this and my 2 cents…..Connect at some point (sooner rather than later), with resellers in your territory as many of them specialize in HBDI combined with sales training i.e. Mo Bunnell and BIG for example, and they may have contacts/relationships with prospect companies that you are contacting.     I had this come up just this week with a reseller in Atlanta, who works specifically with the sales and marketing group at Home Depot so now, she and I are going to leverage that relationship and I’ll bring her into the account with L&D and Operations/Strategy divisions, which is where we play, so we can work together and combine efforts to expand HBDI across the entire organization.",Low-D
"LOL! You were busy schmoozing and building relationships….all the RED stuff that you love ;-)   On the E-mail Hunter – there is a plug in for LinkedIn. Download it! When you are in Sales Navigator, you’ll now see a “hunter” tab. (attached is a picture). When you click on it, a logical company e-mail address will come up (second picture) with a confidence score. WAY COOL!! Off and running now on prospecting and messaging.",Low-D
Looks like Zech has it on our calendars for next Thursday!,Low-D
My vote is for RSM...differentiates our role from AM with little or no explanation needed.,Low-D
"Not opposed however just a head’s up that flying in and out of Omaha is not easy…hardly any direct flights so folks usually get routed through Chicago, St. Louis or Denver and the airfare can be pricey so that may be a deterrent.",Low-D
Rest up!! We all miss you.,Low-D
"Speaking from my experience thus far, get with them quickly. I’ve already wasted too much time on what I thought were “warm” prospects based on web-site traffic and other indicators, only to find out that they are accounts “owned” by a reseller. HubSpot is great for a lot of metrics related to website phising etc. but I’ve discovered that the “leads” that will pop up, are 9 out of 10 times, tied to a reseller – and HubSpot does not give us that level of visibility – only NetSuite or Donna do. Bring on NEW LOGOS!!",Low-D
"Thanks Quinton! One day….trade-shows or at least the exhibition part of it will probably go away. I know in companies that I’ve previously worked for and even done some consulting with, that it is always the largest line item in their annual budgets with the least ROI (I’m sure Betsy would agree).",Low-D
Thanks! Looking forward to a prosperous 2017!!!,Low-D
"Thanks. I’m local  - well, 30 miles north of downtown ATL! If you stay at any of the recommended hotels, everything is within walking distance of BIG, including restaurants etc. Let’s touch base on this towards the end of this week. I’ll be completely out-of-pocket the week of October 10th.  Your account manager (not sure, who you have?) should train you on Axon so you can pull your profiles and also set up “no charge” HBDIs. Unless I’m running around out of the office in meetings, this makes it easier for me but our AM team is there to help.",Low-D
Ugh.. I hear you on making the contacts stick to an account record. I’m having issues there too. Not having problems with  my notes though. Maybe we are trying to get HS to do too much for us sales folks?!?! Just saying!,Low-D
Welcome to the Herrmann Team Virginia!,Low-D
"Welcome to the team Jeff!!   If you need any help with anything, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I came on board in May as a CRM for the southeast. Looking forward to meeting you in person later this month.",Low-D
Cheers!,Low-D
Woo Hoo!! Stay strong.,Low-D
Welcome Kelli! Looking forward to meeting you in person.,Low-D
This Friday is open (except for my weekly call with Dominic at 10:30 am EST if that happens this week?).   Next week is Cert in Atlanta but I can make Thursday work.,Low-D
That works.,Low-D
"2 of the 8 Deals tagged as Marketing for me are truly NEW Accounts that came in from our website: Arylessence and Brisk Coffee. Having said that, these two accounts heard about us because 1) account did a team WS with a reseller almost 4 years ago (Arylessence) and 2) attending a chamber event in Florida where CINTAS was the keynote speaker and they talked about HBDI (Brisk Coffee) – so not sure how those get attributed to Marketing?",Low-D
"Other notable points: I have nowhere near the pipeline I need in order for me to hit my 2017 quota. According to this spreadsheet, I have 24% 2017 Quota through February,  as it stands today and that is only if every single deal I have forecasted closes.  I’m 76% short on forecast for the year and really need 3Xs that in my total pipeline at 50% or higher so I have to continue with my self-generated, targeted prospecting efforts and leverage resellers where I can.  I could keep going :)",Low-D
Attached is the one I did for Southwire.     Won’t be on the Player’s Only call. Too much to get done today and I was traveling Thursday and Friday last week.,Low-D
Awesome! Is there a communication going out to customers who are on Axon to notify them of the new feature?,Low-D
Be safe!!!,Low-D
Ditto. Too much to do :),Low-D
Ann just emailed me and needs to speak to me at 2:30 regarding some issues we are having with UCB over in Europe. Can we push our call to 3:00? I'm sorry for the last minute urgent request but Ann has to call over to Europe after our call.,Low-D
"Welcome Naomi! I look forward to working with you  Looks like you, Beckie and myself are the newsest memebers of the Herrmann team.",Low-D
"If you find it, can you please share with all? Most of my e-mails on DPP have been “one-offs” after I’ve had a conversation with a customer so mine are pretty specific.",Low-D
Can we schedule a Players Only call for this month? It has been awhile.,Low-D
Checking now and I'll get back with hopefully today.,Low-D
Tomorrow works great. Morning will be better up to 1:30 or any time after 3:30.,Low-D
"Also, I’ll keep you in mind for any sales phone calls that I schedule and loop you in if you would like? Although I’m still learning, I feel like I’m beginning to get a good flow working.",Low-D
"No worries Zech. Hope everything is okay. I know for me, I jumped only because I was out last week and then in Grow BIG this week so I’m still buried and needed the extra hour back in my morning.",Low-D
My vote is for RSM...differentiates our role from AM with little or no explanation needed.,Low-D
"Many thanks for your reply.  Doing the individual debriefs with the team members is all part of the team debrief process so that is just fine.  With regards to the meeting with Karim, the 30th July is currently free for him between 9am and 4pm.  Is there any particular time you would like to book the hour in for?  Also would you like to do the call via Go To Meeting or Skype or a phone call?  We are happy to do whichever works best for you – and we can set up the GTM and send you log in details if that is preferred.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"Could I please get your advice on how best to deal with the situation below in terms of Netsuite.  Joanna Floyd was at Bain Capital and had booked to attend Cert in September with us.  Bain Capital have already paid the full amount for Cert as they wanted to get it paid before the end of their financial year.    So we have a Netsuite record #2113 for the order confirmation with the payment against that currently.    Should we move this record under Joanna's new client record and mark her Bain Capital one as inactive?  Or should I leave the Bain one there as it has the payment on it and we haven't officially invoiced for it yet, and set up a new one at zero cost against her new record so it shows up as her attending?  I think option 1 would be best but wanted to check with you first.  I hope you can help.",Low-D
"Thanks for coming back to me on this and letting us know, I'll update Karim on this news as well so he's aware.  We wish you the best of luck for your last week at Bain Capital and for your next venture, and we look forward to welcoming you onto the course in September!",Low-D
"Seeing as Karim just replied to that other email, I’ll run it by him quickly I think, I think he will say yes too, but would rather have that in writing!!",Low-D
"Thank you, I can't wait now, just 3 more weeks of work and 5 weeks until the estimated due date - couldn't come soon enough as my body seems to be giving up on me now!",Low-D
"Thanks for confirming Christine, please look out for the email from our fulfilment team either later today or tomorrow with the soft copies and the tracking details.  If you have any questions or queries at all please do not hesitate to contact me.",Low-D
"Do you mean you have tried to put an entry through or you can’t even see it?  It takes me to the questions, but I haven’t tried to enter anything myself – although Paul did a test and that worked.",Low-D
This just came through - I'm guessing it's from you!,Low-D
"Thank you Dorothy, that’s perfect.",Low-D
"FYI…. It’s a difficult one as I know Bowman and Paul wracked their brains for the best way to have the form show ‘within’ our website as Karim wanted – and this was the only way.  So email responses are the only way.  What do you think?  (By the way, the form is not findable on the website – people will only find it if we share it with them).    When are sure that we are going to use it and we have updated it fully I will replace the Survey Monkey website address on the Pardot redirect so that it will remain the same website address that we send to people – the redirect website address.",Low-D
"Many thanks for coming back to me on this I really appreciate it.  I’ve spoken with our Managing Director, Karim Nehdi, and explained the situation to him in full.  He has agreed to sell the support tools to you based on our existing relationship with the BBC and your understanding of the information I gave previously about the games being used in the correct way.    He would also very much like to see you train in our tool when you have the availability next year, so we will keep in touch with you as and when dates for 2015 are published.  As yet we don’t have them in place, however there is usually one in February, one in May, another in September and the final one in November (which is most likely to be held in Paris).  I’ve added you to our mailing list so you can be one of the first to know when we publish our new dates.",Low-D
"With regards to the tools, the prices would be as follows:-  Whole Brain Mat: £149 Diversity Game with Expansion Kit: £94 Diversity Game Extra Cards: £30  Please note these prices are subject to VAT and P&P.  We would be able to send them out to you by next working day courier and our cut off time to deliver the next working day is 1pm each working day.  I look forward to hearing from you should you wish to go ahead and place the order.  We have your address as follows from your original enquiry, could you please confirm if this is the correct address for billing and for delivery?  Also if we need to send the invoice to a certain email address or if we require a PO number from you for the order please do let me know.",Low-D
"I just had another look and yes I found it, I’ve just noticed that in your first email you’d said her surname was Bertrand, not Bernard – which explains why I couldn’t find it!  It was sent on the 14th October to Sophie originally.  Do you need a new hard copy printed or were you just looking for a soft copy?  I’ve attached a soft copy here for you.",Low-D
Could I follow up with you on this?  Have you made any progress?,Low-D
"The 1st July would be best if possible as Karim is taking an HBDI session on the 4th.  On the 1st he is currently free anytime except between 2-3pm when he has another call.  Would you like to confirm which time works best for you?  Also I don’t have a telephone number for you on file, could you share that with me, or are you happy for me to set up a Go To Meeting via your computer with Karim?  Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"I’ve just heard from Karim to say that he won’t be able to make the call at 11am this morning, so I have pushed the call back to 12:15 instead.  I’ve resent the calendar invitation to you showing this, so if this time works for you could you please accept the invite?  If this doesn’t work for you he is also available between 3-4pm today or is looking quite open for tomorrow.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"I’m well thanks I hope you both are too.  That’s great news that the session went well, I’m really pleased to hear that!  With regards to your practicums, you don’t need to do any paperwork at all, so long as you have done the debriefs Karim will just talk to you about how those went, he won’t be looking for any paperwork to be submitted.  You used to have to submit paperwork, but Karim took that out earlier this year and I had told you both back then, but you will probably still have the old paperwork which still talks about it – so you can ignore that!  So if that is ok for you – that you don’t need to do any prep work for it – are you still ok to meet or would you like to rearrange?",Low-D
"If it was really bad yes I would stay at home, I did one day last week, but it’s nice to get out of the house while I still can, so I’ve just been doing a slow walk into the office!    I hope you manage to find two strong men to help with the boxes!",Low-D
"I haven’t heard back from Michelle yet, so I’m not sure if she will be available for the 12:15 slot.  I’d give her a shot on GTM and if that fails perhaps try her mobile which she told me was: 01258 4zr 333 (from a Blackberry) – so I’m deciphering that to be 01258 497 333.  If she isn’t there please just let me know and I’ll chase up for another time.",Low-D
"Please find the quarterly sales report attached, with the second tab for Q2 now added.  If you have any questions or queries at all please don’t hesitate to contact me.",Low-D
"The 1st July would be best if possible as Karim is taking an HBDI session on the 4th.  On the 1st he is currently free anytime except between 2-3pm when he has another call.  Would you like to confirm which time works best for you?  Also I don’t have a telephone number for you on file, could you share that with me, or are you happy for me to set up a Go To Meeting via your computer with Karim?  Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"Thanks for letting me know, I’ve just pushed it back to 12:15 for now while I check with her if that works.",Low-D
"I set up the order to be looked after by our fulfilment team earlier this morning, although I know they had a lot of orders to get through so hopefully it shouldn’t be much longer until you receive the soft copies from them by email along with the tracking details as they will be sending that out today to you.    If you have any questions or queries about the reports or the delivery please don’t hesitate to get in touch.",Low-D
"Have you got a screen shot of it?  It’s a Pardot form so I guess we would have to take it up with them…  have you tried again since, starting from the beginning?",Low-D
"Do you mean you have tried to put an entry through or you can’t even see it?  It takes me to the questions, but I haven’t tried to enter anything myself – although Paul did a test and that worked.",Low-D
"Thanks, that does make me feel better! ;-)   Hope you are having a lovely time in Paris!    My brother arrived last night for his stag weekend in London, so had a bit of a late night as we had to pick him up from Stansted at 11:30pm to stay with us and he’ll head to London today.  So tired – need coffee!",Low-D
"No, it looks like it was meant to be there! Karim just spotted I spelt Katja's name wrong (with a y), so annoyed with myself as I should know better!",Low-D
"I have just had a chance to look at this properly.  Firstly I’d like to say thank you so much for doing this, I really appreciate it.  The page looks great to me, do I take it that the page is not accessible to anyone unless we share the link with them or is it accessible by anyone from the main site?  If so could you let me know how you can get to it from the main site?  I noticed a couple of things on the form results that came through from you (attached).  1)     Question numbers 2 & 3 don’t appear on the email 2)     On the email it mentions Cell Phone, yet on the web page it mentions Mobile Phone – that’s not a problem, I just wondered why that was? 3)     Question 9 mentions organisation, yet on the email it is organization – again I just wondered why that was?  Otherwise I think it’s perfect, just what Karim was looking for.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"Option 1: One of our certified practitioners can meet with the individuals 1-1 to do their debrief, the cost for this would be approximately £495 for just one person, or £1500 for a day of 1-1 debriefs for up to 7 people.  We would recommend this option to be able to get the most out of the tool as it can be tailored to meet your individual’s needs.  Please note that these prices are subject to VAT and expenses if applicable.",Low-D
"Thank you so much for your reply, I did think this might be the case.  Especially as both companies have certified practitioners of their own – it is just that Jenny and Sue are fulfilling their orders.  I will arrange a call with them to explain.  So what I did was move their folders into their Miradorus account so they could pull only the relevant groups, then I moved the ones that weren’t their own back.  They didn’t have access to the main HTMS for this as I worked it that way.  There weren’t that many, but you can see in their Miradorus account which folders they have if you wanted to take a look.  None of them are companies who have practitioners at them, it’s all their own work.   I hope this is all ok?",Low-D
"I think the Herrmann logo has moved itself over, but that’s not the end of the world – we’ll just go with it!",Low-D
"It’s worked!  Thanks!  You just relax and enjoy your evening, you’ve done your hours for the day!  Have a great time in Paris!",Low-D
"Thanks for letting me know, that’s no problem at all, I just wanted to check you received it ok and that everything made sense as I know it was a lengthy email!  I’ll wait to hear from you soon when you have had a chance to speak with your boss and we can go from there",Low-D
"Thanks for your email, and don’t worry about apologising I understand, I just feel bad for chasing you guys up on it!  I’m sure if you explain to her the reason for the delay she’ll be fine – although she might not be if we can’t sell her the Diversity anyway – which may be the case!!",Low-D
I just wanted to follow up with you on the email I sent to you last week.  Did you have any questions at all and have you given any thought to the pair profiles?  I look forward to hearing from you soon.,Low-D
I just realised I didn’t hear from you yesterday so wanted to follow up with you on this.  I’m out of the office today so would be unavailable by phone but I will be there tomorrow if you wanted to chat then.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.,Low-D
"Could I chase you up on the below if possible please?  Also if I am to move the folders, is there a cleaner way to do it, as I realise under each account there are multiple ‘clients’ so it could look rather messy in Jenny and Sue’s Miradorus account?",Low-D
"Virlina wrote this up earlier today so she could have a practice at it and I had checked it over and was going to send it now, but I’ve just had second thoughts on a couple of things…  1)     I’m assuming VAT doesn’t apply to them as the session is taking place outside of the UK – I did email Leslie to check that yesterday but haven’t heard back – do you know, as we should mention it on the LOA if we are going to apply it?  2)     Travel expenses – I just remembered these weren’t mentioned in your original proposal, but we usually do charge for them, should we keep that in or is the price you are offering a flat fee, we won’t charge for travel or accommodation?",Low-D
"I’m sorry to chase you up on an email but as you can see the client is getting a little impatient and really wants a reply.  I had sent the original email over on Friday and again on Tuesday and Kim replied to say she would forward on to Gippy again in case Torrence hadn’t done so on Friday.  I’ve replied explaining that I will follow up again and I’ve explained a little background in that you may be looking into this further to check she or someone at her organisation is a certified practitioner as we do not sell to uncertified practitioners.  So she has some background as to why we may be taking our time.    Anyway, I’m doing my bit by forwarding this one, I am sorry to chase you on it!!",Low-D
"Many thanks for your email, I’m well thank you, I hope you are too?  I’ve just had a look at the email below yours and this seems to be a US order as it is with Solution pricing, so I have therefore copied in Bethany as I believe this will need to go through her.  If I am mistaken though Bethany will be sure to let us both know and I will be sure to help further.",Low-D
"Sure, I’ll do that as soon as I can.",Low-D
"Virlina just shared this with me.    I know that it is the Chelmsford office and my name that is down as being the official office should they visit anywhere – Oury Clark had warned me of that when we processed your visa things.   So given that I will be moving out of that office and that I won’t be here for the next year, should we enlist Oury Clark’s help to update the records with the Home Office?  We wouldn’t want them turning up to find out I’m gone!",Low-D
"Many thanks for your email, I’ve made sure you are on our mailing list for when we make plans for 2015 certification workshops.  So we will be sure to be in touch with you again later in the year to update you.",Low-D
"I've added to the spreadsheet - as it wasn't on there I started to wonder why it rang no bells, why I hadn't put it on there and why I could find no folder for her in my Cert inbox.  Turns out I was on holiday that week so this would have been one of the US team replying - so sadly I can't find her initial enquiry form with any info from her about who she is.  At least I'm not going completely mad - which is a relief!  I knew I didn't recognise it - and now I know why!",Low-D
"Thank you so much for your email, I’m so pleased it all went well – it wasn’t easy finding the hotel after gaining quotes for hotels throughout Europe, then trusting Trip Advisor when you can’t visit it yourself, so that is a huge relief!  It sounds like it was a huge success all round which is fantastic news – and a great start to the European collaboration effort!  You will have to keep me in the loop as things progress when I’m away for the year.  I hope you all have safe travels onwards!",Low-D
"No she wasn’t fussed at all – I had pre-warned her that things might not go to plan back when we booked so she would have been prepared for a last minute change.  Plus I did try to call her and the call wouldn’t connect, so I suspect you would have gotten the same problem anyway.  I’ve asked her to double check the number just to be sure for next time.  What a pain about the flight – at least you get a bit of time to collect your thoughts before jetting off though!",Low-D
"Set to deploy at 3pm UK time.  By the way, I’m not sure what happens to the bottom section with the social network links when an email is forwarded (it’s fine with the original copy), see below.  Plus I’m not sure it looks all that great as it is now, with the white background and the different style font – just thought I’d mention that.",Low-D
"It’s funny as we had another order for 90 profiles to go out today too – it seems to all come at once then not at all!  But yes it will definitely boost our Q2 sales, thank you!!",Low-D
It looks fine in the one you sent me?  I haven’t touched the saved version…,Low-D
"I just tried to call you and the call wouldn't connect to your mobile so I'm dropping you a quick email.  Karim has just called me to say he is terribly sorry but his flight has been brought forward and he is leaving for the airport now and will be unable to make the call for your debrief.  With regards to re-booking, he has some space available next Tuesday or Wednesday if either day suits,  there are a couple of one hour meetings on each day but if either day works the same time, 10am would work if it does for you?  If these dates don't work, I can let you know some further dates or you could let me know your next availability?  I look forward to hearing from you soon and once again Karim sends his sincere apologies for the last minute change.",Low-D
"Many thanks for your reply.  It looks like it is just John Simpson to complete, is he the chairman you mentioned is away?  If he completes before 1pm Monday then we can have the profiles delivered before 9am Tuesday or there is a before midday option – although that would be cutting it really fine.  Otherwise another option which I didn’t mention is that we could send all the profiles that are complete out, along with a blank profile (which would be charged at the same price) for you to print John’s results on to just in case he completes at the last minute.  I would send you everything you need to print and I would send you the group 4 page PDF and slides by email as soon as he has completed too.  Does that sound like an option you would be interested in or would you rather wait for him to complete and us send it all when that happens?",Low-D

"Thanks, hopefully it will be ok – it just seems to come from no-where and all of a sudden I can’t move because it’s so painful!  I’ll see how I go today…",Low-D
"Sure, I’ll do that today and send it together with the instructions based on the price you quoted in your proposal for 35 people over 3 x half day sessions.",Low-D
"That’s a shame, my best intentions!  Good luck getting them out!  Hopefully not too much else will need to go out too.",Low-D
"Thanks, I’ll send to her and to Graham this morning.  Also on a side note I just wanted to let you know that something has happened to my lower back/right hip which means it keeps failing on me and being really painful when I don’t expect it when I get up or when I’m walking (probably something to do with all my muscles and bones relaxing I guess).  It was really bad on the weekend but had gotten better, when I woke up this morning it was pretty bad, so I’m working from home to save me having to walk into work!  Hopefully it will sort itself out by lunch time and I’ll walk in then.  Otherwise a trip to the doctors might be in order, as I’d mentioned it to the midwife on Monday and she told me if it continues to see one.",Low-D
"Thanks Louise, glad you and Jay are on top of it all!",Low-D
Many thanks for letting me know.  I’ve gone ahead and added the self-processed team reports to the same order as everything else so you will only be invoiced the once.  Please find attached the order confirmation – the invoice will follow shortly after the order has been dispatched.,Low-D
"Thanks for following up with me, it’s been a crazy day and I haven’t had the chance to look at it properly yet which I had hoped to before the end of the day, but this looks unlikely now as I am busy trying to set up last minute details for a session taking place next week.    I certainly did receive the email – but I just wanted to check it over for any Anglicisation needed etc. so I wanted to have a chance to look at it properly – which I should be able to do tomorrow as I finish for the day in 10 minutes now.  Thank you so much for your help with this, I will be sure to be in touch tomorrow.",Low-D
I’m back now – just going to log out of Karim’s and into our GTM and move the meeting to now…,Low-D
"Further to your email, from an administration point of view, (although I note the final dates of the sessions are still in discussion), in order for myself and Virlina to start working on sending out the HBDI Survey Instructions to you to pass on to the group and in getting an LOA to you to sign would you be able to confirm if the total number of participants is going to be 35 as previously mentioned?  If this is incorrect please could you confirm the total number?  It would be good for us to have a breakdown of all the names from you too and a note against who will be attending which session so we can be sure to keep an eye on completions of the survey in time for the sessions to take place.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"Ok cool, I’m just working on the inventory update/order, then will head out, so will give you a shout when I’m back.",Low-D
"Also, could you please change the name of the following so it’s a little clearer, thank you:  *         Foursights Poster change to - Foursights Poster: Your Preferences At Work  *         Communications Poster change to - Foursights Poster: Communication",Low-D
"Please find Darren’s HBDI soft copy attached.  The hard copy has been dispatched today to arrive tomorrow via UK Mail, tracking number 40658380000376.  I look forward to hearing again from you soon.",Low-D
Did you look after this after speaking with Alexander on Friday?,Low-D
"There are still 2 more profiles to complete on your order before we can fulfil it for you.  If John and Dave don’t complete before 1pm today then we won’t be able to have the profiles printed and sent to you today to arrive tomorrow.  If they complete before 1pm tomorrow then we will be able to have them delivered to you on Friday, which I’m guessing will be the last possible day as the session is on Monday.  Failing that you could pay a little extra on courier charges and have delivery on a Saturday or before 9am on the Monday if required.  John Simpson Bryan Raven - COMPLETE Dave Isherwood Paul Millington - COMPLETE Simon Needle - COMPLETE Chris Nicholls - COMPLETE Peter Threadgold - COMPLETE Richard Wilson - COMPLETE  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
Give me a shout when you would like to ‘meet’ – I can go to lunch later if you think it will be around 1pm UK time…. Let me know,Low-D
"Many thanks for your new order that’s great news, I’ll ask our fulfilment team to put the packs together for you and get them sent out as soon as possible.  Most likely they will be packaged and sent out tomorrow to arrive on Friday.  Please look out for an email from them with the tracking details so you can be sure to keep an eye on the delivery.",Low-D
"That’s no problem at all, I just wanted to give you that option – you never know they may all be keen and complete early anyway!",Low-D
"Forgot to add something about the HTMS set up, see below…",Low-D
"Ok so let me go through what you covered below:  *         New client record – I would always create a company record and then individuals underneath that record, so I would have created INSEAD as the main ‘company’ and then Katya – or whomever is signing the LOA/in charge as the record underneath that as it’s not her on her own, it is the ‘company’ who are purchasing this from us – I’ve done this now.  I’m a bit lost now with all the emails that have gone back and forth – they still haven’t decided definitely on dates have they?",Low-D
"I would send instructions to Katya now to share out with all the people due to take part – but I guess she won’t send those out until final details have been set so she can send in a more rounded email to everyone – also we would really like the LOA signed or at least sent before we go handing out an access code?  Perhaps we can discuss this afternoon – shall we bring our call forward?    Sadly I noticed that one of the Thinc webinar emails dispatched this morning – if I’d have only checked that yesterday I could have changed the date on it – grrr, I didn’t see the harm in waiting to do it together!  I’ve therefore changed the date in a couple of places now in case of clicks from that email, but we can still go over what I did together and change the last email together later.",Low-D
"Sure, will send Virlina instruction on how to 'switch it on' - Dorothy sent them through a while ago when she first set it up but as we haven't done it since I'll send some over quickly again now.",Low-D
"I don’t think you meant this email to come to me, so I’m just letting you know that it did as I’m assuming you meant to forward to your accounts team!",Low-D
"Here’s a list showing what you have ‘used’ this month under Miradorus, the HBDI’s are under Sue’s name and also now an 8th is showing under your name.    Although having now noticed the team profiles, I wonder if the team reports are meant to be there – perhaps when you moved people over into your account it moved the team report records too.    Could you confirm?",Low-D
"Great thanks, and I take it that you haven’t printed the 7 in your Miradorus account yet then, so they will be printed before the end of the month?  I’ll make a note of the new numbers and go from there come the end of the month.",Low-D
"That’s no problem at all, thank you so much for your help.",Low-D
"FYI, following the email below from Michelle, I have replied and thanked her for her honesty with her response, and suggested that I set up a time for you to speak with her about this further as perhaps you can help her see the potential in completing it and come up with a solution that works for her in getting the practicum done…?  She used to be at BBC and now works for herself.",Low-D
"Thank you for your email and honesty with regards to completing the certification.  Listening to feedback like yours is really important to us as we are actively looking for ways to make our certification easier on practitioners, so I was wondering if I would be able to kindly ask you to have a call with Karim Nehdi to discuss this further?  He may be able to come up with a personalised solution to help get you certified in a way that works best for you.  If that is ok for you perhaps you could let me know your availability, I can see Karim is available next Tuesday-Friday, would any of these days work for you to set up a call?  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"Karim: See email below from Justin Michaels about doing his first pair with his fiancée and us sending the profile pack to him as she hadn’t received it before – I’m assuming this will be just fine as we do encourage people to do their first pair with someone they know well as a sort of practice run, but can you confirm?  Also can you confirm you are happy for us to send the profile pack and for it not to be included in his free practicum quota seeing as she took it before Cert and didn’t receive one then? Or shall I insist she uses the TA and we only send a soft copy of her profile and the pair report?",Low-D
"Dorothy: Please can you move Karen Beardwell’s profile over to the UK database in preparation for it being used for Justin’s practicum, also it would be good to have it under his database permanently anyway rather than in the US (where I am assuming it is located as I cannot find it in the UK).  Could you also check if she had access/completed TA as I’m assuming that is why a profile was never printed for her?",Low-D
"Karim has forwarded this to me to look after next week, but I just wanted to get some background on the enquiry as it looks to be a US enquiry - why has it now come to the UK to look after?",Low-D
"I'm happy to, but is there a reason it's come over to the UK, it looks like a US enquiry judging by the spelling of Inquiry...?",Low-D
"Great thank you, I’ll check with Sue, even if it’s not actually used in the sessions, Sue might like to have a soft copy just to help her prep for them anyway perhaps.",Low-D
"In writing up the LOA I asked Karim if team reports will be needed for each session and he doesn’t think so, but asked me to double check with you.  Will you be using team reports in the sessions or are they not needed?  I guess I could always send you copies for your own prep but not for use in the session.  If you could let me know that would be great.  Thanks.",Low-D
"I am so sorry, I was doing so many soft copies that day because fulfilment were unable to do so I must have gotten mixed up there.  I’ve attached the usual Alphabetical List that comes with HBDI profiles here for you.  I hope you have a lovely weekend and once again I apologise for sending the wrong data.",Low-D
"Yep, I’ll run it by her!  See what she says and let you know, thanks!",Low-D
"I received an out of office for Julie until 7th July, so I will just send the LOA as it is when you agree to it and explain she can change the numbers before she signs it.  Could you please check it over and check that you agree with it all, especially the highlighted text – for example, I’ve assumed HBDIs per person will be done, but will you also include a team report per session?  I’ve also included in there a post workshop review, as that was included in the last session we did for Capespan – is that still the case?  Is there anything else you agreed to provide or they agreed to provide that I have missed?  Finally, I haven’t asked for a deposit up front, as we don’t usually do so unless for example we are providing the venue.  If you would like a deposit to be made upon signing of contract please let me know.  Many thanks for your help.",Low-D
Just realised I didn’t BCC you in…. So FYI,Low-D
"Many thanks for your email.    I can confirm that the 23rd September is available, so we have now held this for you and we will put together an Letter Of Agreement for you based on this date and the 2 x training sessions in one day for 36 participants in total.  If the number of participants has changed since your email on the 22nd May please could you let me know, so I can ensure the LOA is written up correctly before sending it to you?  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",Low-D
"Thanks Sue, I’ll go for 22nd or 23rd and let you know.",Low-D
"FYI, Sue is available for that date.  Would you like to reply to Julie or shall I?  Also, now that a date is confirmed it would be good to get an LOA written up and signed.  Have you agreed rates and what’s included with Capespan at your meetings with them that we could use to get one written up?",Low-D
"I’ll ask Louise what is going on, as certainly the brain numbers were completely out when she checked those and I know other things have been out as Virlina recently checked up on profile board numbers and that was showing as a minus figure on their inventory when they had stock.  So I’m not sure their master file is 100% reliable at all!",Low-D
That’s no problem at all.  Seeing as the inventory doesn’t seem to be 100% accurate I will ask Louise to check everything and once she has done so I’ll review what we need to order and come back to you.  She isn’t in the office today but I’ll ask her to do this as soon as she is able to and get the ball rolling on it asap.,Low-D
"I told Louise to stop as soon as you sent this and she’d already done 19.  But either way there would still be that same fulfilment charge for picking the items, it would just be doubled if they have to put them together.  If that makes sense?  It confuses me!  I’ll await further instructions…",Low-D
"Option 2: We have an online tool which teaches about Whole Brain® Thinking as well as gives an individual access to their profile results.  This is called the HBDIinteractive™ and the online learning tool can take approximately 3 hours for someone to go through fully.  This option would cost £195 + VAT per person.  This option is obviously the cheaper of the two, but it relies on the individual taking the time and concentrating on the learning tool so they can fully understand their profile and Whole Brain® Thinking, it also cannot be tailored to their needs, so if they had any questions about their profile etc. they could not be answered personally by a certified practitioner.",Low-D
"Thank you, Dominic, Ann, John, and the entire Herrmann team.  Thank you also, personally, for all I have learned and value about Whole Brain Thinking!  It is now a part of my DNA and has made a difference in many areas of my life.  I will never forget all of the wonderful people on the team I have worked and partnered with.  It has been a pleasure and I appreciate the teamwork on our client initiatives.  I wish all of you the best and look forward to seeing and hearing all the new ways WBT impacts the world!!",Low-D
"Oh my, Bowman!  Glad to know you are okay and wishing you a speedy recovery!!!",Low-D
"Welcome to the HI Team, Zach!  Looking forward to meeting you and having you as part of the Sales team.",Low-D
"That is great and thanks for sharing, Karim!  The website is looking really good – white space, business focus, etc.  Thank you to the team for creating and improving this for our clients and future clients.",Low-D
"Congrats, Quinton!  Nice solution and thinker dollars!!",Low-D
"CONGRATULATIONS, Laura!!!!  So glad to have you here and thank you for all you do to contribute to HI.",Low-D
"Yes, thank you all three for putting this together.  It should make a definite difference in the client experience, as well as more efficient internally at Herrmann which could lead to a cost savings.",Low-D
You're welcome. Yes it will be or at least provide a date we'll have it completed by. Will need to reconfirm in regards to the first classes for leaders can it be the current version until it is completed. Having the new look of the portal is a first good faith forward. 508 compliance will also be important.   I kept the virtual cert high level but they will want date in that also.,Low-D
"First of all, please know I am sending this discussion document so you have information prior to the call tomorrow and for our reference.  My intent is not for you to read this on the weekend, as I’d like to honor non-work time.  My apologies I did not get this to you Friday, however was back to back calls from 8-4pm.  Dorothy, I’m not sure you are able to join, however now that I recapped the notes and there are items regarding Axon and privacy on the survey it would be good if you could join.  If you are unable, then I can connect with you separately.",Low-D
"Good Morning, everyone!  Wanted to share good news from a team webinar Curtis delivered for us for the Global IT Leadership team at Coca-Cola.  Below you see the note from the client that it went very well and it has positioned us for the next tier of leaders (40 of them) for June 15th….yes, quick turn around and will be having the call with Peter this morning to confirm outcomes.  The session on the 15th will be a ½ day session.  Thank you, Curtis, for doing a great delivery and having impact to take it to the next step.  Thanks, also, to Ashley and Bethany for getting facilitator arranged and access codes out to meet their quick deadline.  It is greatly appreciated.  Have a great rest of the week!",Low-D
"Thanks.  I have meetings tomorrow and Thursday (pretty full), however have open time on Friday if that works for you.  Or is it something we can cover on the Monday ibm call?  Or did you prefer to talk separately?",Low-D
"LOVE it and thank you so much.  It worked.  I clicked link to do TA and was able to log on, just so can show seamlessness.  I’ll watch for new link tomorrow.  Thanks again for all you’ve done on this and the partnership!",Low-D
"Thanks, Bowman, for the below.  Am I understanding you correctly, that in looking at the below info in your email, we could be compliant fairly easily or begin the process for it?  I have not answered IBM yet on this as I want to ensure to provide the most accurate information and so as to put us off their list of development available to use.  Could we discuss on a call Monday as my meeting with them is on Tuesday (I shared with Rich we could discuss in the meeting versus me emailing the info).  He was open to that.  It bought us a little time.",Low-D
"Welcome, Dominic, and looking forward to having you join the HI team!  Randi Jo, it has truly been a great experience working with you and wishing you the best in your future opportunity!",Low-D
"OMGoodness!!!  I LOVE it!  Thanks so much.  Agree will not position will be similar for future clients.  With being in cert tomorrow and then travel for rest of evening, Monday is only day I have for a walk through.  How do any of the times look for you?  9-10am eastern 1-1:45pm 3:30-5pm  Just let me know and I’ll set up the meeting.  Thanks.  I’ll feel out ibm during the meeting on it.  If it’s a deal breaker, I’ll let you know Karim.",Low-D
"Thanks so much, Leslie, for letting us know.",Low-D
"Congrats, RJ!",Low-D
Ok.  I’ll set up a gtm in case we need to look at the portals together - visually,Low-D
Is someone setting up the conference call or do you prefer I set it up.  Fine with either.,Low-D
"Good Morning, Bowman and Christina.  Are we on for the call this morning at 10:30?  My schedule is getting tighter by the minute and then will be at ATD with very limited time or none for a call.  I would like to provide thoughts/answers for these portals that you may have so you can move forward on them.",Low-D
Works for me,Low-D
Sure.  I’m open the following times Eastern:  Between 8:30am-11:30am  Between 2-5pm,Low-D
Congratulations Donna!  That’s a lot of Thinkers!!!,Low-D
"First of all, welcome to the team Christina and I’ll look forward to meeting and working with you.  An update/facelift to the IBM portal would be fantastic…as IBM is needing and asking for us to be more updated, fresher, etc look.  They responded really well to the look of the HBDI App.  Here is the link to our dedicated portal for them.  I think even in the writing, directions, etc – any verbiage where we can add words such as Agile Thinking, Agility, etc – that would also be really beneficial.  http://www.hbdi.com/ibm/",Low-D
"Just put in your first name followed by @ibm.com and it will let you enter.  Then, the next step most take is the section that says I want to explore or purchase products.  This is where they purchase their TA (they actually call it HBDIinteractive – so I think we need to stay with that name?).    Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.  P.s. my meeting with them is now going to probably be the first week of June and I will be showing this to them in the presentation.  So, if there is any way to have some of this done by end of May for them to gain a visual idea and we be able to demonstrate that we are serious about our commitment to them and moving in that direction, it would be great.  Take care and have a great week!",Low-D
"I am very well, and I hope you are the same. Thanks for asking!  To confirm, yes you will set up the access code through the HBDI Administration portal (HTMS). If you need any assistance with this please let me know and I will be happy to walk you through.  I will be gladly set up an order from my end for the materials that you need. Please let me know the quantity of package materials that you would like to order (must be in quantities of 10), the shipping address, the date you need the materials by, and preferred method of payment (credit card or invoice).  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward to your reply.",Low-D
11am is all I have for this morning. I sent an updated invite.,Low-D
Could you place this order below that Jeff is requesting? This needs to go out today and be shipped 2day for delivery on Tuesday if at all possible.  Let me know if you have any questions and/or concerns.,Low-D
Please see the e-mail below from someone at IBM who wishes to take the assessment. Could you please direct her to the IBM Portal.,Low-D
"Thank you for updating me on the number of remaining seats for EFH.  I updated the SOW; however, I need actual dates to use in the Agreement for AXON migration. Can we discuss this tomorrow and figure out the best date to use?",Low-D
"I went through the e-mail again. I think you covered all of the high-level points perfectly. You gave him enough information to build a case, but not so much information that it will drown him.  I added a couple of trademarks in blue, but those are the only edits that I have. Let me know if you need anything else.  P.S. I really love this idea if I haven’t told you so already ;)",Low-D
"Sorry for the delayed response. Since this is out of the box, I had to ideate with Leslie.  We can do this and we will sell the perf. sheets to UCB as an individual item.  The cost if they order blank perf sheets to print themselves would be $2.00 per sheet.  If they want us to print the information, the cost will be $12.00 per sheet and it will follow the normal 24 hour timeline for processing as standard HBDI’s®.   Let me know if you have any additional questions.",Low-D
Can someone help with the request below?,Low-D
Can someone look into the e-mail below?,Low-D
Can you answer Brenda’s question?,Low-D
"Cynthia Radford (SC) would be the closest facilitator that we have; however, she is a master facilitator and her rate that she charges us would be $2500.  Let me know if you want me to ask if she is available.  My next suggestions would be Curtis Curry (FL) - $1500 and Yvonne Gaines (NY) - $1200. UCB would be responsible for their travel & expenses.",Low-D
"I have provided the amount spent from Fossil in 2015/2016 below:  2015 Total: $26,483.75   2016 YTD Total: $23,104.82   You will find full details of the purchases in the excel sheets attached. Let me know if you have any questions. :)",Low-D
Please approve the attached expense report for Jeff.,Low-D
Do you have a specific contact name vs. just SAP?,Low-D
"Please send me your revised WEB Reports from my request earlier this morning ASAP.  Dominic is awaiting the revised report and I need to get this to him before tomorrow morning.   If you have any questions, or need assistance please let me know.",Low-D
"At your earliest convenience, could you reach out to Eric and assist him with moving forward with the TA.",Low-D
"The customer & speaking engagement reference on this order is incorrect. This was pointed out yesterday and not corrected before approved.   Finance,   Please correct the alignment before billing.",Low-D
"I hope this e-mail finds you well.  Since Leigh declined our offer for the CRM Position on the West Coast, Dominic would like to start interviewing a new set of potential candidates to cover the vacant territory.  Could you please start pulling resumes again? As you come across qualified candidates please send the resume’s directly to me. I will work on having them complete the HBDI® and schedule an initial phone interview with Dominic.  If you have any questions please let me know.",Low-D
"It is so nice to hear from you. It has been a while. I have recently transitioned into a new role at HI; however, I have copied your new point of contact Bethany Fields.   Bethany is the Account Manager for UCB and she can help with the request below and any future orders/logistics that you need.",Low-D
Thanks Karim for the information below.  Could you and Yosuke confirm what time zone you will be located in next week and make sure your calendars are up to date. I will coordinate a time that works for all 3 of us to select our focused fundamental.,Low-D
Can you set-up and send access for Jeff to enter the CP Site?,Low-D
This is a great start on the Fossil proposal. I have attached my edits and DC may want to make a few last minute changes.  I basically went in and made sure all of the font in the correct format and changed the sizes of some of the pictures to make it fit and flow better. Let me know if you have any questions.,Low-D
Thanks. I sent an invite for tomorrow at 3pm CT. for Dominic to call you.,Low-D
Dominic is out of the office until tomorrow. I will take a look at his calendar to see what he has available and will send over an invitation.  Can you tell me what the agenda will be for this call?,Low-D
We can review tomorrow. I haven’t had a chance to review either one so I don’t have a good read on what he wants yet. One is in a word document and the other is in an e-mail over bullet points.,Low-D
I hope this e-mail finds you well. Dominic asked me to connect with you to work on the Job Description and Offer Letter for our upcoming new hire – Anne Griswold.  He also has a question about her address as well. Could you please let me know a date/time that we could connect? Dominic would like to see both documents completed by Wednesday 2/17th when I have my call with him at 2:30pm EST.,Low-D

"Our company has a policy for director and above offering ""unlimited"" PTO - time off as the business needs dictate and allow.  However, this seems to work well for some directors, and not as well for others.  We have directors who have already taken 5 weeks off as compared to others who haven't even taken 5 days off.  Does anyone else have an unlimited PTO plan?",Low-D
"I’d like to make sure we’re all on the same page and we’ve made the business case before proceeding with ThinkerHub or Thinker Hub. My questions are:  1. Has this been discussed and a decision reached to trademark this name, and are we planning to stick with this particular name? Up to now, I have heard ThinkerHub referred to as a place holder. Keep in mind, each filing runs several thousand dollars and I am not sure what our budget for 2015 is yet.  2. Is this the intended name for HI’s use, or is this only being used for a specific client?  3. In which countries do we intend to use this? I must supply that information to Sheri at Altera before we can proceed.  In addition, Sheri will have to do the official search of this term before we can go forward.  Please take a moment to read over these and think about if this is the direction we’d like to go before we incur the expense to start the process.  Ann, John and Karim, I’d like to have your approval before proceeding.  Thanks!!",Low-C
"Sorry to bug you…Karim and the Global team are asking for the call and these slides. Were you able to post them yet, and if so, can you provide the link?",Low-C
I sent to both of you only because I had heard Bowman was in an accident and had surgery and not sure who would handle these types of requests.  Sorry for the confusion.,Low-C
This is perfect! Thank you!,Low-C
Thanks so much for the quick action!,Low-C
Time does fly when you're having fun! Thanks everyone for a great year. I'm looking forward to many more with my awesome colleagues!,Low-C
Thanks Bowman…dumb question…how do I get to WordPress? Is there a link from our intranet?,Low-C
Is there a hyperlink we should use when changing our signatures from “pre-order the book” to “buy the book”? It would be nice to be able to link the buyer directly to the best source to purchase the book.,Low-C
"If you have not had a chance to take the survey, please click the “click here” phrase below to access the web site. If you have taken it, thanks for your participation, no further action is needed. I would like to gather up the results by Thursday of this week.  Thanks so much for your assistance!",Low-C
"I'm forwarding to our IT folks, as they would have to give you that access. I'm not able to provide it.",Low-C
"Thanks, just to verify, the people in our global offices have logins to this site?",Low-C
"The one you told me to use, and sent you a follow up email saying it said it was uploading. Did you not receive it at all, or could it  be in a spam folder? I sent it immediately after you replied to me.",Low-C
"Is this posted now? Is it password protected, or secured in any way? I’d like to send the global team the link.",Low-C
"Thanks, I’m sending now!",Low-C
"Not sure whom to ask, but hoping for some help locating an editable version of the Coca-Cola case study. I have searched all of the drives I have access to and cannot find it.   If anyone has access to it, would you kindly send me a copy so I can satisfy Hanna’s request below? Thanks so much and have a great day!",Low-C
"I’m including Bowman on this correspondence, as I believe he would have to assign you an access password to the intranet.   I don’t know that you will have editing rights however. If you have changes, you can send them to me and I’ll change the list and have Bowman post it. I know it’s not exactly the best method, but we are currently working to find a better solution for sharing for all of the global team and Herrmann corporate.  I’ll provide updates on our progress and when we will implement a new platform for communications so stay tuned!",Low-C
Great job RJ! Congrats!,Low-C
Welcome! I'm looking forward to working with you Yosuke.,Low-C
"I just received a customer assignment for a Melissa Hammer at RPC Global who wants to go to the NYC Cert. in August.  At first I thought this was a direct client and is the “RPC Global” printing company in Houston, Texas.  However, I now think this is “RPC Global” consulting services in Illinois (see link below).  http://www.rpcglobal.com/   If everyone agrees with my conclusion, can the AM team re-assign this to Donna/Reseller Channel in HubSpot and NetSuite?  Then Donna can reach out to Melissa.  But, if you guys think this is a direct client, let me know and I’ll reach out.",Low-C
"A couple of days ago I re-aligned the Macquarie group to you, can you follow up with this lead? Jodie might have a candidate for the New York Cert. in August for you.",Low-C
"I LOVE this, Emily!  This definitely appeals to my 102 score in green!  I’d love to see all AMs adopt this (or at least a version of it). Then they can share info in a hurry with their CRM or Dorothy/Andrew/Val/Leslie whenever needed --- just a suggestion.",Low-C
Please see my notes/feedback in column M of the attached document pertaining to all my accounts in question.  Please let me know if you have any questions.,Low-C
"I’m working from home today, too.",Low-C
"Here’s yet another HubSpot lead that I received a lead assignment for, but is already assigned to Zech in HubSpot.  I can also let you know that:  * Doug’s profile score is 113/77/39/65. * Monique Honaman at Incite is Donna’s client. It may be best to just refer Doug to Monique. You may want to ask Donna. * J&J used to have two certified practitioners: Bonita Giedrycz (certified 2007), but she retired. Then there was Cathy Fanning (certified 2006), but I believe she is with a company called Seniority Group LLC now. Many of J&J’s subsidiaries like Mentor and LifeScan have Certified Practitioners, too. However, I’m not sure if they would be able to help main J&J office out or not.",Low-C
"Here’s a lead that came into me which I re-assigned to Donna in HubSpot because this person is already in NetSuite as a certified practitioner belonging to the reseller channel.  Donna can you follow up if need be?  Yosuke, why did I get this lead assignment?",Low-C
"Yes, I know both Kirsten Melin and Kathryn “Kate” Lee --- I will check with Kim for more details.  Thanks!",Low-C
"I didn’t see any notes on this lead that just came in from HubSpot… is there any missing data you can pull to help me know what she wants?  (Also, I’ve actually spoken to this person in the past and she was working with Cynthia Radford via Sue Farmer (one of our UK resellers), but I don’t know why she’s reaching back out to me now. Any notes or background information would be helpful.)",Low-C
"I don’t believe there is an opportunity with this gentleman. I’ll reach out to touch base and make certain, but I’d say it does not look at all likely.  I didn’t mark him as an Axon primary contact in NetSuite, though. I’m not sure who/how that got selected. I just wonder if there are other non-practitioners like Mr. Gaze who are in a similar position?  I wonder if there was some sort of query that could be ran to see if any other non-certified practitioners are also set up as AXON contacts ---- maybe Leslie can check for us? She is the Queen of NetSuite.",Low-C
I received an Axon migration notification request from a customer named Timothy Gaze. This person is NOT a certified practitioner. He bought a WBBB and the teddy bears last year and that’s it.  You can ignore this person’s request.  The bigger question is how did this person get an Axon notification E-Mail? I thought there was some sort of filter on the NetSuite data to only send this to current certified practitioners.   Copying DC and Ashley just to keep them in the loop.,Low-C
"I hope your travels back home went well. I’d also like to say thanks for providing lunch the other day. I apologize that I wasn’t able to eat with everyone due to a conflicting call, but I was able to hobble down the stairs on my crutches to grab a much needed slice or two of pizza that afternoon!  I wanted to follow up and see if we should have Yosuke remove the listings at http://www.herrmannsolutions.com/blog/portfolio-item/herrmann-hbdi-certification-workshops/ for May 17-19 Cert in Atlanta and the TBD Cert. in May for Dallas.  With the REI Cert. in Seattle the first week of May, the Washington DC Cert. in the last week of May and the potential dedicated Cert. in Chicago for PriceWaterhouse Coopers also slated for the last week of May it might be a good idea to remove Dallas and Atlanta options from the calendar. I don’t think we have anyone signed up for those sessions yet anyways.  What do you think?",Low-C
"Betsy --- At first I thought these requests would be an easy clean-up task that could help a sales person easily find the correct contact record to put their notes in and save them from having to sift through the multiple records, but Yosuke’s explanation shows me it is not so simple to merge the records. So, I understand now.  I sincerely do appreciate Yosuke’s help and attention to finding a workout around or alternative solution.  Thanks --- let’s have a great week!",Low-C
I’ve reached out to this prospect to get more info on his situation. I will bring in Michael to help if needed.,Low-C
"Ah, okay. That makes sense. I didn’t know why I got that request from Anita and wasn’t sure how to craft my message to her…   Can we change the auto-align assign alerts to only notify me of anyone with 200+ employees? (unless of course they requested a quote/consultation --- in that case I would want to speak with anyone and everyone)",Low-C
"Here’s a prospect for you that is located in Frisco that I re-assigned to you in HubSpot.  This guy took the HBDI in 2010 and wanted to talk to someone at Herrmann about bringing it to his team, but we never were able to connect --- maybe you can circle back with him and provide help.",Low-C
Will do… I’ll see if I can trade some T.A.’s to her in exchange for some vacation packages! :),Low-C
I just assigned you a non-profit customer called Orleans Public Education Network (O.P.E.N.).  You can reach out to Deirdre and see how those two trial HBDI+Thinking Accelerators they tried out went and find out if you can help her with a another T.A purchase or possibly a workshop.,Low-C
"Thanks, Kelli!  I should have 2-3 more applications coming in from Varian in the next week or so and maybe a couple of other folks from other companies, as well.",Low-C
"Here’s one to reach out to for a “Hail Mary” pass if you have time tomorrow: gave her numerous options and prices for potential workshop, webinar and TA with Sales leadership and sales team on 03.13.15. she told me they will pass because another part  of company is doing different assessment on 05.19.15.   This has probably a >1% chance of being revived, but hey, you never know!",Low-C
Will this affect our clients at all?,Low-C
"Wow! $43,750! NICE!",Low-C
Thanks so much to all those who created the ATD review document and to Jennifer for sharing it. This was tremendously helpful!,Low-C
Way to go. Donna!!!,Low-C
"This is perfect, Betsy! I love how the Certification program is being referred to as a “partnership” in the .pdf because that’s really what it is.",Low-C
"Man, this is awesome! It’s stuff like this that makes me really proud and feel very fortunate to be a part of Herrmann.  Thanks so much for working with MITRE on this, RJ! You’re the best!",Low-C
"… and happy birthday to Dorothy, too!",Low-C
"That is good news! Thanks for sharing, Jennifer!",Low-C
WHOA!  That’s awesome!,Low-C
Does anyone have any experience with this?,Low-C
"Thanks for the reminder, Brenda!  I totally forgot about this expectation requirement! Should someone remind Donna, though? --- I’m not sure if she does WEBs or not anymore.",Low-C
"Great question (and a great response by Zechariah in his reply) --- Here’re my musings:   Whenever I talk to a client or prospect about reinforcement I keep it really simple and easy --- I tell them that every participant that goes through any kind of HBDI Training should get a desk flip ($15.95 each). I’ll even include the attached .PPT deck so they and their folks can learn how to use the desk flip more effectively. I’ll always recommend the Walk-Around pads, too ($17.95 for a 5-pack). These are good to bundle into a Solution Model if you can, too.  Another resource that the practitioner can hand out to thinkers are our wallet sized Job Aid cards* ($58.95 for a 100-pack).",Low-C
"Thanks for sharing, Zech: This is perfect for our new expectation to spend 3 hours a week improving --- I like watching stuff a lot more than I like reading stuff!",Low-C
"Thanks, Yosuke ---- where on the marketing landing page is this? Could you send the exact URL so I can go right to it?",Low-C
"This lead is for Medtronic which has headquarters in Ireland has 80,000 employees worldwide. The person that wrote in is based in Minnesota.  So who should this lead actually belong to? Brenda, Sarah or me?",Low-C
"Oh, yeah! Anne Griswold is top-notch! I’d love to have her do it, too!  Anne is really good at asking framing why WBT is important for every aspect of your business. She “makes the case” so to speak.",Low-C
"Looks good… My only suggestion would be to rephrase the bullet-point: “Coordinate a 2-hr debrief webinar with a Master Practitioner.” ---- I think we can do the intro to WBT, break down the HBDI en masse and pitch them on partnering with us all in one hour. I think two hours is too much/too long. I think the only “Master” Practitioners” in the U.S. are Chuck, Cynthia, Anthony and Ann herself. (I think Curtis Curry might be one, too.) However, I think Ann or Karim (possibly even reaching out to Kevin Sensing*) would be the best picks as not only are they adept at teaching the WBT stuff, but they can also “sell Herrmann” for us, too.  Just my thoughts for what they’re worth.",Low-C
Forget that story! Did you know the Lake Lure office is closed today? And did you know the cops came out yesterday??  Craziness was afoot!,Low-C
"Good question. My answer: I don't believe David really saw a 38% - 63% split. I think he was mis-seeing"" it.",Low-C
"I looked at all the profiles in his Practicum Folder in HTMS and there were a couple of 38/62 splits, but no 38/63 ones.",Low-C
"Can he provide the name of the person who he says got a 38% - 63% split?""",Low-C
"Yes, thanks, Zech!  I never thought of presenting that type of info to an existing client to egg them on to renew a contract or purchase more assessments. It’s a very yellow quadrant way to show blue quadrant info!",Low-C
Just checking in on v. 1.0 of email signature & letterhead that was due yesterday and today v2.0 is due. Is it in google folder for Christina to edit and give feedback on today?,Low-C
"The excel sheet is in the google drive for the overall big pic timeline. Sharing is done through google driveIf you want to use design space, let's bring that up in the meeting on Friday...especially if that's easier.",Low-C

"Julie may have open slots for breakouts. I’m on the phone with Ann and she suggests we put her name in and swap out at last minute, once we get someone lined up.  Attached are the sessions. Ann is thinking the first, but we would need to find a replacement. This is not a new session. Julie needs answer quickly.",Low-C

"Would you like your name to be added on our holiday cards? If so, see below:)",Low-C
"Can you give me an update on below re: any forms that I need to complete for health benefits change status from FT to PT? Effective 2/1, I should not be paying for benefits via Herrmann.",Low-C
"Good morning Chris, Thank you for the update and we will adjust accordingly. Have a happy Thanksgiving!  Good morning Betsy, I’ll revise the case study redesign project timeline and share the updates during our 121 tomorrow.",Low-C
Good morning! Just a reminder for below in yellow:),Low-C
"Not real sure how to handle this one.  I do not believe there is a chance for future business here.  Dominic was unpleased last time I charged for an individual assessment stating we don’t do B2C business.  I’m guessing I should turn this over to a practitioner in Nebraska? Normally I would just use the following template, but I’m not looking to get in trouble for using it?  What are your thoughts?",Low-C
"This is probably one of those things you can help me with to keep off of Bethany’s plate.  This came in as a lead, but how would she have purchased an assessment online?  I’m missing something here.",Low-C
Attached is my FSA enrollment.  Thank you!  Also I’m assuming I can spend my FSA money on my kids even if they are not on my plan correct?  Also I don’t have the insurance premium information to complete on the form so I left it blank.,Low-C
I have already contacted all of my leads.  I’m sorry I was responding as they were coming in.  I did my initial email response and planned to follow up via phone tomorrow if the number was listed (most are not).  I’d prefer to respond personally to all of them if that is a possibility.,Low-C
"Do you know who this is?  I don’t recognize the name.  I looked him up in Axon, but all the people with that name have older profiles.  This one was completed today.",Low-C
"I was hoping you could help me with this piece.    They are going to be buying two TA’s from us for $150 each before buying the next 14 at $250.  How do I go about getting this set up for them?  Not sure if we just provide a link and bill later or how that works.  Also my document I have is for the HBDI and Fundamentals and not for the TA.    Thanks for your help, and excuse the ignorance.  First one like this…",Low-C
"Thanks for getting back to me.  I’m glad to see I’m the first!  I agree with your assessment of the professional networker, but I’m okay with that label.  Everyone that goes to these events are there to promote themselves, their business, or both.  I think the only thing that offends people when it comes to networking has to do with how they network, not that they are networking.  If one person recognizes our logo from across the room, and strikes up a conversation then I think it is worth it.    Since we don’t have one already made up, I’m happy to just use our logo off the marketing landing page and have one created.  Up to you, I just didn’t want to step into your arena without permission.    Thanks as always!",Low-C
Big thumbs up.  Thank you as always!,Low-C
"Attached is your profile code.  Thank you for the time this morning.  Please let me know when you have had time to review, and we can take a deeper dive.    A few items that may be of interest due to your involvement in simulation training:  The first is called the thinking accelerator which is an automated tool that provides the assessment, model overview,  and debrief combined into an online tool.  The other is a really fun tool we call the text profiler.  The short explanation is that it is a tool that allows you to input text, and it will provide an analysis of how balanced it is towards each quadrant we discussed.  Our practitioners are using the tool to make sure their training material is geared for all types of thinkers so that it is better received.    Looking forward to our next talk.",Low-C
Calendar update has been sent.  Talk to you this afternoon.,Low-C
Thank you for taking the time to help me understand what you are trying to accomplish through the use of Whole Brain thinking.  Attached you will find the document we discussed with instructions on how to access the assessment.  Once I get the results back we can schedule your debrief.  From there we can look at how to proceed with the rest of your team.  If you have any questions please just let me know.    I’m looking forward to working with you!,Low-C
Certainly.  I already have a 2:30 scheduled. Would 3:30 central work for you?,Low-C
"Wednesday the 4th at 1:00 would be perfect.  I’ll follow up this email with a calendar invite.  The meeting will be a “zoom” meeting which offers video chat, and the ability to share our screens.  If you are able to download the app prior to our meeting that would be great.  If not, you are welcome to simply dial in on the number provided in the email.  I look forward to meeting you.  Enjoy your time off this week, and happy new year.",Low-C
"I have a call scheduled with Anne tomorrow to practice and go over schedule.  Can you clarify your email.  I read it as:  If she is available have her come in to Dallas for the meeting, and if not then rehearse with her prior to the meeting.  I just want to make sure I’m on the same page that you are on.",Low-C
I’ll wait to hear from you before I go back to Rana.  I want to make sure I have everything that is needed to cut down on the back and forth with her.,Low-C
"Ashley sent out an update yesterday, and I hope your counts are rebounding.  If you are up to it, I would love your input on this clients question.  I know this isn’t an earth shattering deal, but I’m sure it is a scenario that will repeat itself often here at Herrmann.    For a quick refresher.  JT sat in on this qualifying call with me a few months back.  They were exposed to Whole Brain through a reseller, and due to the growth Matt was inquiring about certification so that he could expand the program throughout the organization. He went ghost on me for a few months, but seemed to re-engage 2 weeks ago in response to my request to have him sign up for brainbytes.    My question:  Would you do the Sandler reverse here to make sure the question I think I’m hearing is the one he is actually asking, or simply answer his question since I believe he is prepping the numbers to present to his boss for approval and checking on his own availability.",Low-C
"Thank you for the vote of confidence for bringing me into the Herrmann family.  I’m only four days in, but already enjoying the decision to come on board.    I’ve been asked to schedule some time with you to review “Global Team Structure & Dynamics, and “Current Learning & Development Products”.    I’m guessing my schedule is more flexible than yours is right now, but if you can give me two windows of time that would work for you, I’ll make one of them work from my end.    Thank you again!",Low-C
"Thank you for the explanation.  I do sincerely want to comply with your orders.    Our meeting with Transamerica you referenced was my second week here on August 17th.  I took notes, but it is certainly possible that at the time I did not know enough about our industry to fully comprehend what you were telling me.    This is what I have from my notes from our Transamerica meeting:  * Understand what business objective they are trying to accomplish. * Understand who is involved in the decision making process. * Understand if a budget has been outlined to accomplish their stated objectives. * Understand the timeline that this will take place over.   Perhaps we can review it again during our focus coaching on Friday?",Low-C
"We quoted $185 with no agreement that included the walk around pads and the start thinking workbooks.  She is asking for a pay as you go with only the assessment.  I don’t see the pricing of the workbooks on the pricing sheet so I can’t work back to the number.  However, the walk around pads cost $18 per pack of 5 so. $3.60 plus whatever the workbooks cost.  Do you have a number that you would like me to be at?",Low-C
"I just sent the invite.  As for details,  I put everything I know in my original email below. I’ll be on the call to do introductions and kick us off.  If you would like to talk prior to then just let me know  Thank you!",Low-C
"So official answer:  4k per library, or all 4 for 12K.   I also asked about team dashboard.  I’ll update as soon as I know more on that.",Low-C
Anything ever come from this?,Low-C
"Just wanted to follow up with the voicemail I just left.  Can you assist in getting my profile information to Macey?  I’m happy to do it, but not really sure how.  I appreciate your assistance.  Andrea will probably have the same request coming to you if she has not already reached out.",Low-C
"I know you are in Lake Lure this week, but was hoping to schedule some time with you to get a better understanding of your role, and how we can best work together.    Would you be available for a call on Monday at 2:00 or Wednesday at 9:00 central?  Please let me know which you would prefer, and if neither works feel free to offer an alternate time.",Low-C
I requested the hold.  I'll follow up with the coordinator first thing in the morning.  Talk to you soon.,Low-C
"Can you please provide a contact for a reseller that I can send over a request for an individual profile assessment?  This contact is based in Texas, but if you have someone that is willing to do debriefs via phone or video chat then I’ll just use them as a reference going forward.",Low-C
"I don’t believe she can do what she is asking until she is on Axon, correct?",Low-C
I cancelled due to the chaos at the office.  Stay safe!,Low-C
Following up our conversation.  I’m looking for two types of information.    Lists:  Customer purchases (of mine) going back 5 years by year.  Intent is to see who has bought and has stopped buying so I can reach out to them.  Thinkers list of people located in my geographic area going back at least 10 years.  I need to know what company they were with when they took the HBDI and when.  Building on that list or a new list would be my certified practitioners in my geography.    Thank you for your help with this.  If you need further info from me to make this happen please just let me know.,Low-C
Can you provide access to the shared sales team drive?,Low-C
"I wanted to follow up the voice mail that I left a few moments ago regarding your request for information you submitted through our website.    Below is my contact information.  Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience, and I'll do my best to answer any questions you have.",Low-C
Looks like we are one step closer to working with JPS Health.  They are asking to make one change to our contract.  Can you advise as to whether the change is acceptable at your earliest convenience?  I also understand you are out this next week.  Next week is fine.  Thank you and I hope you are enjoying your week off!,Low-C
"I’ll try and give you a simple response to a complicated question.  Pricing begins at $95 per team member, but discounts are applied to multiple purchases.  There are many variables that can factor in, but the $95 figure is a good starting place.    I’d love to schedule a call to go into more detail.  Currently I have two blocks of time available for the week:  * 2:15 Central on Wednesday 3/1/17 * 10:30 Central on Friday 3/3/17  Just let me know what time is more convenient, and I can send over a calendar reminder. If neither work, please feel free to recommend some times for next week and I’ll do my best to accommodate your schedule.  Looking forward to speaking with you.",Low-C
"Good afternoon Bethany.  Do you show pace industries as having another assessment available? If so, can you forward the instructions to Ben that is listed in the chain below?",Low-C
"I made a note to follow up on the conference you were referring to for February, but just realized I’m not sure which one you are planning to attend.  I’d like to see if we will be there.    I do know that we will be hosting an event in the second quarter in DFW.  It will be a group of our practitioners coming together to share their experiences so that they can grow as a collective group.  We will also be inviting some key organizations that are interested in adopting Whole Brain thinking so that they can learn about the experience from others that are actually using it.  If you would like I can make sure to add you to that invite list.    I hope your new year is off to a great start.",Low-C
Good afternoon Kendra.  I spoke to Bethany this morning.  She will set up a link and email that over so you can share it with your people.  She will also generate the new invoice.  Sorry I should have relayed this back to you earlier today.  You should see something from her tomorrow.,Low-C
"Good afternoon Kyle.  Great spending time with you yesterday.  I left with a much better understanding of what you are trying to accomplish through the HBDI and Whole Brain Thinking.  I already have support for your plan to conduct a pilot.  Just let me know when you are ready to proceed, and I’ll get it set up for you.  If you would like me to be there for the debriefs, or the workshop I can make myself available.  I leave that completely up to you.   Lastly,  I do sincerely appreciate you letting your friends in the Houston and Austin ATD know that I’ll be there Thursday and Friday respectively.  If you are interested; I think a fun idea would be to give them a complimentary assessment and debrief.  Just give them my contact information, and if they would like to take it I’ll provide them a link to access it.    If you need anything at all, just give me a call!",Low-C
"I was asked to send over Flight requests for our company meeting.  I just picked the cheapest flights in the windows of time that Ann M. Specified.  If you need to move them around at all please do at your own discretion, I’m flexible.     My Advantage number is: #V6099E8  My Precheck # is tied to my AA account, however if you choose a different airline my Precheck number is: TT11GQ7VX  Please let me know if you need any additional information from me, and thank you for setting this up.",Low-C
The March workshop has not been finalized yet.  I would expect to be able to answer your questions in the coming weeks.  I will respond back with specifics as soon as I am able to.    From a planning perspective we can offer assistance once we get closer.  Registered participants will each receive a document similar to the one attached with helpful information on their stay.  Is your plan to attend the March certification?,Low-C
"Good afternoon Melissa.  I hope you enjoyed your holiday time.  I probably enjoyed mine a little too much!    I was hoping to schedule a quick introductory call to get to know you better.  Do you have a 20 minute window of time Wednesday (30th) any time after 1:00, or Friday (2nd) any time before 12:30?  If so, please just let me know what time would be best and I’ll send you over a calendar reminder.  Looking forward to meeting you.",Low-C
Ok..so that’s a little trickier…I think that profile is in the Sandbox.  I’ll need to re-enter it into Production.  I’ve added it to my calendar for this afternoon after Sprint planning,Low-C
Happy Friday and Happy Labor Day Weekend.  Thanks to the Axon Team for more Progress for us and for our Clients!  Kudos to Andrew and Jake for the techno-magic!  Today we updated the Axon Server and made some significant improvements.  The easy way you can tell if you are seeing the updates is to look for new Announcements on the Dashboard when you sign in.  We switch the Servers over and it takes a little time for everyone to see the new stuff depending on Internet Servers around the world.  #1 You may have experienced some “slowness” and maybe some time out issues.  We have made some additional improvements…this will be especially true for Clients.  (We are working on some ideas to help with our internal searches since we have access to so much data…more to come on that!)  #2 Emails from Axon have been “SCRUBBED” for possible spam filter issues.  Should perform even better from the Axon email server now.,Low-C
Attached is a PDF of screen shots of the Thinking Accelerator.  This “might” help you find things…but it is screen shots of pics so the text isn’t copy-able.  I’ve reached out to the Hurix Team again…I needed to anyway…I was expecting the last installment of corrections.  So I’ve asked if they can “extract” the text in a use-able format.  We’ll see what they say.  I’m still trying to think of other places we can pull the text from.  There is the Booklet for the HBDI of course….but it doesn’t have “everything”  I’ll keep looking.,Low-C
Super…can we avoid Mondays if possible?,Low-C
I’m not free on Mondays until after 12:00 as a general rule. Could we do this later in the day?,Low-C
You should have it now…you have 12 hours to reset your password…these requests do expire.,Low-C
Let’s go for it!    I would love to live in a simplified world!  Thanks Betsy!  Sounds like we have new opportunities with Hub Spot!,Low-C
Please see my response and the attached to Victoria’s request for a copy of her original job description.  Just wanted you to be aware of her request.,Low-C
"Wouldn’t it be great if no matter where you are in the world* you could submit a “ticket” when you need IT support from Herrmann?  Your wait is over! Check out this page:  http://support1.hbdi.com/  You will want to save this page as a favorite.  Then anytime you need help, just fill in all the information you can on this page, and it will automatically alert Paul to your need.  This system allows you to ask for help AND follow-up on requests. It also helps us determine where the challenges are happening most often, and track the time it takes to solve the challenges.

If you are wondering about your 401K in this “interesting” time…here is an email from our 401K Counsel at First Citizens.  I thought you might be interested….  See below and attached.,Low-C
Gosh Bowman! Are you ok?  Do you need anything?  How badly are you broken?  Life is certainly full of surprises!,Low-C
It looks like you might have a window at 2pm today.  I can make that work if that’s better for you.,Low-C
"I wasn’t sure if you would be able to attend, but I did want you to know that this will be happening  :)",Low-C
I’ll make Friday work…no matter what.  It would be great to have any ideas from them in advance so I could prepare with some possible responses or plans to better our security stance.,Low-C
"I have prepared the documents and I will be sending them over in just a bit.  I realize it is late in the day, sorry but I had another Client urgent request come in this afternoon.  I will sending the files by our secure system called DatAnywhere/Varonis.  Please let me know if you do not receive the files.",Low-C
I’ll do all in my power to finish this today.,Low-C
I was on vacation yesterday.  I did send in the requested email to sign up for FSA.  Did you not receive it?  I’ll send again.,Low-C
I search everywhere for over an hour.  Turns out her email address wasn’t correct in the Zenefits site.  Leslie has just updated it.,Low-C
Just saw your email from this morning.  I’ll try to get into Kim’s email.  Give me a few minutes.,Low-C
"I do not have many of the Role Matrices…there was an initiative about 18 months ago to get everyone’s matrix developed, but they were not sent to me…I believe they were sent to John, and the ones I do have are quite old…one for Paul, one for me (pre-Axon) and one for Laura Wang…none relevant to today’s Herrmann world.  I’ve attached the Job Descriptions we’ve put together over the past couple of years.  But you may need to reach out to each Leadership team member to get more info.  Or I can try to dig into email archives, but that could take a bit of time.",Low-C
Thanks for enrolling me in the FSA plan for $750 for the 2016 plan year.  I’ve noted the info in your email below too.,Low-C
I’d be happy to help if I could but this is where Shanna Lelli can help you best.  I’ve copied Shanna on this response in hopes she will be able to help you.,Low-C
We’ve had two more good interviews with Joe Chronister and I’m ready to move forward with Reference checks.  Please see his references below.  I’m hoping I can schedule a meeting for Joe here in Lake Lure and with Ann very soon.  Would you be able to check out his references this week if you can reach these folks?  See below,Low-C
"Missing work and trying to deal with the issues around the consequences of that would probably push me way over the edge.  So no I’ve pushed myself to be here in the office everyday…and many days lately have been 10-12-14 hour days…at the office and then at home.  Physical ramifications…yes…all classic symptoms of stress…stomach issues, headaches, arrhythmia, but nothing that has been so bad that it exceeds my fear of letting things get worse by not being here.  I don’t want it to get that bad…that’s why I’m interested in getting help now, before I breakdown…  I have made an appointment with a Psychologist, but I didn’t ask about WC…didn’t know if was even an option.",Low-C
"I have a more direct question regarding my personal situation…If I see a psychologist to help me deal with stress at work, is that considered covered under worker’s comp?",Low-C
Based on this week’s needs we could be a bit premature in moving him to part-time as of 1-1-16  Do we have a time frame in which this must be done?  He has essentially agreed to be PRN for me…but I don’t know what that looks like from day to day just yet.  I am really struggling with being without his help and I don’t want to do anything to jeopardize that or to make a change and then he ends up having to work 35 hours this week…just to help me out.  We are experiencing the murphy law this week.  Computers dyeing etc.  I’m hoping the dust settles soon and that we have a replacement soon too.  When we have a replacement that could be another “full” week of work for Paul to onboard him with all the systems we have in place.  I do have a few references for one of the Paul replacement applicants that I’d like you to check out for me.  I’ll send them along shortly.,Low-C
"On a side note, I’ve spoken to Ann, but I might need a little HR ear too.  I am drowning in the sea of stress and struggling to keep above water.  I have never been so stressed out her in all my years.  I might need an ear or some other options if you know what I might have available to me…from a company stand point.",Low-C
He and I are going to discuss tomorrow.  He still hasn’t gotten an answer about his PTO and if we’d pay him for the days he “earned” in 2015 that he would normally take in 2016.  He did suggest that we could extend his end date into 2016 and he could help onboard the replacement if that meant he could get his time.  I could really use his help in training up the new person…when I find them!,Low-C
I can check with her to see if she wants someone else to do the enrollment…  but I think first she just wants enough info to say “I’ll stick with whatever is closest to what I have.”   She just doesn’t have the capacity to compare and contrast right now.,Low-C
I asked if she remembered what type plan she has now…that we might be able to suggest the plan that is closest to that one.  She couldn’t even remember.  But that might help.,Low-C
Wooosh!  Sorry!  I don’t need to take any of your time for the little things I need…I logged back in and just went straight to enrollment.  Then I was able to select the coverage for myself and my husband in Dental and Vision…it was not apparent from where I started but I found it.,Low-C
"Sorry Shanna, I misunderstood what you needed…I thought you already had this…see attached.  I’ll also go back and find the introduction Email I sent to you and the folks at First Citizens and resend it to you.",Low-C
I just sent the Telephone directory again.  It has some contractors listed too.  Not sure if you want to send the survey to them…  You should have the email from me with the secure link using this same email address.,Low-C
"Bryan   Please meet Shanna Lelli our new HR person at Herrmann International.  Shanna  Please meet Bryan Edwards at First Citizens, our 401K representative/trustee.  Shanna  Bryan would like to setup some time to talk and get you familiar with the plan, and then we also need a time to have a stakeholders meeting to review the plan etc.  He’s going to send me some possible dates for that meeting, but I thought it would be good for the two of you and Leslie to talk about the path forward with your new role at Herrmann.",Low-C
She must have been thinking of the emails from you…those were in her box.  Did you get the link from Zenefits from Kim’s email?  I just sent it over.,Low-C
Call me.,Low-C
I sent these documents yesterday…I’m in a meeting right now.  Can you check to see if they are in your inbox?  If not just let me know and I’ll send them again.,Low-C
"I’ll work with Joe this week to get these type emails to go to the correct contact person, but for now…here is info I received to careers@hbdi.com",Low-C
"Here’s how the update process works.  Work is done and tested in the Development environment.  After all the work for 2 weeks is completed and verified, it moves to the Sandbox.  The Sandbox is tested fully.  If all checks out in the Sandbox, the changes are made to the “Backup” server.  The Backup Server is tested with REAL Client data.  If that checks out we switch to the Client facing server and clients and you will see the changes.  Today we will move updates to the Backup server and the final round of testing for the work listed above begins.  Without complications, the changes should be seen in Axon no later than Thursday.",Low-C
Terrific Tuesday to you All!  This is your weekly Axon update.  As of last night testing in the Sandbox was concluded and updates to Axon will commence…more on how this implementation works below.  Headlines for Axon:  1.    Watch for Videos and Announcements on Thursday this week.   2.    SSV! Billing reports available in CSV and now SSV (for our German office) 3.    Using Cases in NetSuite to track needs and improvements (see notations below) 4.    Assessments have a notation to indicate if they’ve been “Migrated” from the HTMS,Low-C
We’ve been chatting about Inbound marketing. We do 2 webinars per year @ $5k per webinar last year and this year.,Low-C
"I hope all is well. I’m helping to coordinate some activities for the upcoming ATD 2016 conference and wanted to get with you to see if you are attending. If so, I wanted to see if you’re willing/able to shoot some client testimonial videos during the reception Tuesday evening.  I can provide the list of interview questions and work with you on the requirements for the audio/video equipment. If you’re not attending, I’ll come up with a back-up plan.  Thanks!",Low-C
"How goes it? Val mentioned that you’re out next week, so I wanted to sync on the timing of the next round of emails we send for the Axon Migration. I have 253 of your Axon primary contacts who haven’t responded, so we’re going to send it from you.   Here’s the list view: https://app.hubspot.com/sales/1697019/contacts/view/224388/   Two questions:  1. When would you like me to send it? I’m thinking towards the end of next week, but would understand sending after you get back so you get caught up. 2. Would you like to draft the email? I have a generic email that gives the deadline and stuff, but since you’ve had numerous conversations w/ clients, you might be able to hit the mark.  Let me know your thoughts.",Low-C
"We got the final scope and go-ahead to move forward with the list of assets for the Diversity of Thought Toolkit. I invited you to the Basecamp project where you can see the list of deliverables assigned to you https://basecamp.com/2609693/projects/8362831/todolists/38197553  Feel free to add comments, ask questions, and check off the to-do items once they’re complete.",Low-C
"Just as an FYI, I set up the workflows so that leads w/ existing contact owners will notify the contact owner. This should keep them from being reassigned. Let me know if you come across any that don’t.",Low-C
"Thank you for your patience and follow-up. It appears that you somehow requested a consultation from an old web form so it didn’t get to me.  I’d be happy to connect you with someone as soon as possible. Would you mind providing the answers to some of these questions:  * What country are you based in? If you’re in the US, can you tell me what state? * Is this for your business or are you with a company that uses it internally? If you’re with a company, can you give me the number of employees?  Thanks again for following up with us.",Low-C
"Yes, I did have a wonderful weekend. I also had a chance to set up and play with the PandaDoc integration. It was pretty easy to use and once the templates are set up, it only takes a few mins to populate the right contact/company fields.  The pdf is attached as well. I also sent you the email from the system, but I’ll have to see how to make it so it doesn’t require login.",Low-C
"As we’re refreshing all the case studies, we may want to fix the typo for Sotheby’s in the list of clients as Karim requested. There’s also a Sobeys in Netsuite, so we may want to check w/ Karim.",Low-C
There were 464 contacts which gives us an 8.28% response rate.,Low-C
I have the field mapped in the Company record. Can you give me the names of the 9 companies that have this check box checked?,Low-C
"Thanks for reaching out. It’s great to virtually meet you.  It would be great to connect to go over your on-boarding and how you can start adding value ASAP.  We created some of the customer personas for resellers and direct clients for various HR functions (see attached). My VOC interview questions will revolve around their thinking, interests and objections throughout the customer journey.   I’ll follow up with an invite for Wednesday that works for you. I’m looking forward to it!",Low-C
"Sorry Q, I didn’t update the rule for this contact us form for resellers. It assigned it to you when it should have been Donna. Donna, can you follow up?",Low-C
Here’s a lead from Venezuela who selected Canada as the country. Can you (or Donna?) help this gentleman?   Is the standard protocol for anyone in South America to go to you?,Low-C
Sure! I’ll give you a call then.,Low-C

"Here is a review of what we went over on the phone and an update about the rep change. The company name field is causing some issues with creating leads in NetSuite. The two options to fix this are to make a default company name in Bedrock or to make this field required on the contact in HubSpot.     Here are some other quick fixes that need to be made to the select fields are:     - Category field in HubSpot does not have Reseller as option so contacts from Netsuite with this are failing ot write - Subsidiary field in HubSpot does not have Herrmann UK Ltd. as an option  - Netsuite looking for values for following fields on some attempts to create or update contacts - Current Database, Contact Category and Practitioner Status - Your Role in HubSpot is missing Other as an option so contacts in Netsuite with this option are failing",Low-C

"I’m wondering what your thoughts are on creating a questionnaire that has existing resellers submit 1) their area of expertise (I.e. Leadership Development, OD, Sales Training, D&I, etc.) as well as verticals so that we can automatically create lists.   This can help support your outreach to resellers while providing lists of resellers who specialize in specific areas. Here’s a mock-up of what the form could look like.",Low-C

Even though I have repeatedly provided step-by-step instructions on how to perform basic tasks such as searching for individuals in the database, creating groups and generating reports she still contacts both Quinton and me for help on a frequent basis.  I have told her about the capabilities that Axon has verses HTMS in hopes to persuade her to want to get migrated over more quickly. However, she has still not taken the steps in the process to move forward with the Axon migration process.   Any advice that you may have for how I am to move forward with the client will be greatly appreciated.",High-C

Thanks Jennifer. I sent a follow up meeting mentioning that it would be next week or after the holiday. I will touch base with you before I confirm anything with UCB,High-C
"Thanks Jennifer. When I responded to the email last week I asked Jean-Christophe for clarifying information. I am awaiting a reply. Aside from the information Lei with UCB shared (I shared with Ann)  I do not know how much more we will have a head of time. Lei has limited information as risk had only said they were concerned about the number of items we had responded “no” to. Jean-Christophe had specifically mentioned the way we store our data as a reference to one of his concerns. Lei is a strong advocate for us and has worked with her leadership to reinforce support for our continued relationship.  Regarding the Risk Assessment report I was using the one Dorothy send me when her and I spoke live. I sorted it by “no” but that was the only modification to the document. Maybe have Dorothy re-send the version she submitted to ensure we are all working form the same document?   Please let me know if you need anything else, happy to help.",High-C

"The sums will need to equal 264. When you look at the breakout, I have illustrated below, they do.  105 + 60 = 165  105 + 60 = 165, too 60 + 39 = 99 60 + 39 = 99, as well  If you add 105 + 60 + 60 + 39 = 264  So then however you divvy up the scores into modes (right/left or upper/lower), the total scores will be 165 or 99 either way.   99/264 = 37.5 and 165/264 =62.5, so that rounds up to 38% and 63% respectively… that’s how it is over 100%  Obviously, the percentage would round off to fit 100% exactly if the modes were 37.49 and 62.51 (or whatever), but because both ended with a “point five” we got what we had here.  Does that help?",High-C

"Also based on our discussion yesterday, if you get with your Account Manager, they will know how to process the order for the Team Dashboard.

Team – can we get Amy set up training as she has a client that potentially might want to do the Team Dashboard.  She has completed the survey and has a signed contract.  Amy is copied on the email.,High-C
Thank you very much for taking the time to send this awesome note!  Kim is a very valuable part of TEAM Herrmann and we are lucky to have her on board!  Thanks again and hope to talk to you soon.,High-C
"Thanks for the time yesterday Eliza…glad you all enjoyed the demo.  Donna will be getting in touch with you to get you and the team set up to take the Team Dashboard.  Also, please let me know what hour slot we can have to do the debrief at your meeting on the 30th.    Donna – as discussed, the Clarion team needs to take the Team Dashboard soon in order to get a debrief during their company meeting on June 30th.  Can you please work with Eliza to make this happen.  I will take care of the debrief piece on the 30th….let me know if there are any questions.",High-C
"The one the people who already registered is fine.  As for the one we were are still trying to get them to register, I would like to make it feel like they don’t want to miss out on this call.  Can you add some language as such…..you won’t want to miss out on this call or don’t miss out on what’s new at Herrmann.  I’m not the best wordsmith so please make it sound good and send it out.  I am flying back from Phoenix to Atlanta so I will not be able to proof the final version so when you make the changes, just send it out.",High-C
This is an urgent request – see below…can we do this for Maggie at Express Scripts and email to her before noon tomorrow?  Please let me know how I can help.  Thanks,High-C
"This is Mike Jaffe’s new account and Jo is going to attend certification at the NYC one at the end of Aug….could you get her what she needs?  We charged her $5000 of which Mike will receive $500.  Can you reach out to Jo as she would like to host a cert in the fall…I think you were looking at Sept, Nov or Dec….since they are in NYC, we should be able to fill it up:)  Please copy me and Mike Jaffe on communications…thanks!",High-C
This resume is from a friend of a friend…not standing behind it as I really don’t know this guy…,High-C
"When I looked in Hubspot the owner is listed as Quinton and when I look up the company, it doesn’t appear to be a reseller?  If you all want me to reach out or know more details, please let me know.  Thanks!",High-C
"Yeah, probably but that isn’t what I told him…these people don’t listen:(  Thanks for sending it out to him",High-C
"Yeah, so this is a brand new one…don’t think anyone has talked to him yet since I just got his resume yesterday??",High-C
Yeah….I just checked the box for me and my girls but it said plan was not selected by the company yet?,High-C
"Yo…sorry it took me a minute to get back to you with feedback – catching up from being on the road the last 3 weeks:(  Anyway, thought it looked good and thanks so much for putting it together.  Below are my comments/suggestions:  1.       Can we change it from questionnaire to survey? 2.       Can we add a simple intro from me/donna/Dominic – don’t care who – telling them about the conference call and why we are looking to gather this info? 3.        Are the first/last name and email address fields necessary or can they just be confirmed?  Trying to get them to do less to increase the chances they fill out the entire form 4.       Instead of area of expertise, maybe its worded as Primary area of thought leadership? 5.       Under that drop down, the choices look good but think we need to add other and if selected they can free form a topic or content area?  Let me know what you think and I am happy to jump on a quick call to discuss in more detail.",High-C
Just sent it to you in a separate email…let me know if you need anything else,High-C
I would be happy to…my calendar is up to date so just let me know.,High-C
"Not yet Jeff, sorry.  There have been some changes at BIG and this one sort of fell through the cracks on their side. I have a call into Mo right now and will ask when I talk to him.  Thanks.  How is everything going on your end?  Anything I can do to help?",High-C
Hey gang….still looking for a few more folks for this cert so let us know what you got.,High-C
"Haven’t forgotten about you bro…Donna and I talked today and she is reaching out to 2 of our partners who took these in the past.  Once she confirms they are still interested, she will send out their contact info to the entire sales team.  Thanks",High-C
"Quick note that it appears the QC ambivert descriptors got copied into the QD slot too.   Good edits, Ann!",High-A
Excited to join. I’ll do my best not to put everyone to sleep!,High-A
"Curious to know, was this session recorded?",High-A
"As Karim alluded to, the publication process is an arduous journey -- it may take a year or two before it officially ends up in press after submitting, depending on the journal.  However, I agree with Karim that we can write a summary paper of sorts or we can write white papers, blog posts, etc. that reference the paper and the findings therein as long as we cite the paper and its authors as an article ""in progress.""  Let me know if I can help in any way.",High-A
"Our company has a policy for director and above offering ""unlimited"" PTO - time off as the business needs dictate and allow.  However, this seems to work well for some directors, and not as well for others.  We have directors who have already taken 5 weeks off as compared to others who haven't even taken 5 days off.  Does anyone else have an unlimited PTO plan?",High-A

"The only thing I can think of is using google chrome which would be a workaround (has flash compatibility built-in) other than that, it is beyond me. You could try Dorothy, she may know of a workaround.",High-A
"Either date works for me, thanks!",High-A
"My name is Joe Chronister, I am your new IT guy :). I am extremely excited to be working with you all and eager to meet everyone. During my orientation I have updated the telephone directory and made a few changes to it. You can find the Directory attached :).",High-A
"I can work on getting a copy of MS office for you. In the meantime though, you should be able to open MS formats using google apps for work. If the doc is already uploaded to the google drive, double clicking on it will open it in google apps for work automatically. If it is a new document, you can open it two ways. Either you can upload it to your google drive and open it from there, or you can open it by opening the respective Google apps for work link from your taskbar, clicking new document, open document and uploading as shown in the following screenshots.",High-A
"Also note, while one of the perks of everything being cloud based allows for the flexibility of operating from multiple computers, tablets and cell phones, we ask that you do not store files local files (aside from the google drive folder) on devices other than the one provided to you by Herrmann International. On the flipside though, we hope you find joy and take advantage of the perks of being completely cloud based :). Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!",High-A
"Here is a summery/description of the internship:  Junior Cloud Infrastructure Administrator  Duties will include:  * Conceptual Design of Cloud Infrastructural systems such as Google Suite, Microsoft 365, Azure Directory, and more. * Testing and Implementation of various features of the above Cloud Systems. * Data migration from one cloud system to another as well as data population. * Creation and Management of Users, Groups, Permissions and Folder structures of Google Suite cloud environment. * DNS and secure log-on management to various cloud based systems. * Management of Data, back-ups, and archives in the Google Cloud.

"I will be doing maintenance on our email certificates this Thursday night between 11pm and 1am. This is a measure being taken to further reduce email spam. Issues sending emails between these times may be experienced. To avoid issues, please try to avoid using email during these times. If you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach out to me.",High-A
Does it seem broke? Or is it not taking your password?,High-A
No worries :). Hopefully they are getting them even though you are getting that bounce back. It could be something we fix when we go live fully with Axon. It probably has to do with how the email is generated and it’s contents.,High-A
"From the looks of it, it is yahoo.com that blocked the email message and probably 1 of 4 things is happening.   1. It dropped it by mistake   2. Their servers are getting maintenance   3. The email generated is getting flagged and blocked by their spam blocker  4. They gave you a wrong email address  What I advise for now, confirm the email address, wait until lunchtime and try to send again. If you still see an issue try to send to a different yahoo account. Then let me know if it’s not working at all. If you need any help, just let me know and I will be happy to help as well :).",High-A
"Sorry I haven’t had much time recently. I generated a backup code for you to use. You can continue to use the backup code or enter a new phone number to use. When you login it will prompt you to enter a code now, you may enter:  81233419  And that should log you in. If you have any issues please let me know. I’ll get back to you soon with some next steps on work.",High-A
"Done, the email is no longer forwarding! Let me know if you need anything else!",High-A
"Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, today has been a hectic day :). I am glad you were able to create your account successfully.  You will be working with me directly for the majority of the internship, but we may introduce you to the AM team and have you assist them with some data migration they are working on. But you can look to me as your manager, feel free to ping me with any questions you may have, no question is a dumb question, and don’t worry about asking too many.  I’ll get you setup in slack, our chat application, so it will be easier for you to ping me. Some days my schedule gets pretty insane and you might get a delay like today.",High-A
"If you login again it should let you know what your direct dial phone number will be, and allow you to enter the phone you would like to forward it to.  Let me know if you run into anything else!",High-A
"Sorry I wasn't able to get to this yesterday. Yes, we do have vonage. Unfortunately our account doesn't have that feature supported at the moment, however, we do have IP phones that you can hook a USB headset into. So if you are sitting near your router (or switch) I can get one sent off to you and you can try and hook your headset into it.",High-A
"The one I have access to share with you is telling me you already have access to it. I believe though, Dominic or JT have created a different sales folder that they share out. I would check up with them and see if they have any info on it. Let me know if they don't have what you need!",High-A
"This may be a silly question, but are you sending this from our outlook server? And to clarify what I mean by that, do you have any other services you are sending email from such as hubspot or gmail that you are sending this email through?  Those intermediaries are typically the culprits in this case.",High-A

"This may be a new or separate issue, I will look into it!",High-A
"A bit ago the below email was sent out to many of you from a spammer. Please don’t click on the link or download it. If you have, please let me know.  Always keep an eye out for suspicious things like this and feel free to drop me an email or ping me if you ever get something you feel looks suspicious. Unless you know the person sending you files across something like google drive, box, dropbox, etc, never open it; consult me first, I’ll be happy to help.",High-A

"Trying later in the day may work if the issue is one of the first two. If something is flagging it in their spam blocker that may be a bit harder to get around as we would need to change the email being generated. This could be tested by making a yahoo email account and testing sending to it. If that goes through but we are still getting blocked, then either the client manually blocked us (probably by accident thinking we were spam) and would have to unblock us or they gave you the wrong email address.   What I advise for now, confirm the email address, wait until lunchtime and try to send again. If you still see an issue try to send to a different yahoo account. Then let me know if it’s not working at all. If you need any help, just let me know and I will be happy to help as well :).",High-A

Much obliged Betsy!,High-A

The internet issue has been fixed! :),High-A
"I just received a customer assignment for a Melissa Hammer at RPC Global who wants to go to the NYC Cert. in August.  At first I thought this was a direct client and is the “RPC Global” printing company in Houston, Texas.  However, I now think this is “RPC Global” consulting services in Illinois (see link below).  http://www.rpcglobal.com/   If everyone agrees with my conclusion, can the AM team re-assign this to Donna/Reseller Channel in HubSpot and NetSuite?  Then Donna can reach out to Melissa.  But, if you guys think this is a direct client, let me know and I’ll reach out.",High-A
"A couple of days ago I re-aligned the Macquarie group to you, can you follow up with this lead? Jodie might have a candidate for the New York Cert. in August for you.",High-A
"I LOVE this, Emily!  This definitely appeals to my 102 score in green!  I’d love to see all AMs adopt this (or at least a version of it). Then they can share info in a hurry with their CRM or Dorothy/Andrew/Val/Leslie whenever needed --- just a suggestion.",High-A
Please see my notes/feedback in column M of the attached document pertaining to all my accounts in question.  Please let me know if you have any questions.,High-A
"I’m working from home today, too.",High-A
"Here’s yet another HubSpot lead that I received a lead assignment for, but is already assigned to Zech in HubSpot.  I can also let you know that:  * Doug’s profile score is 113/77/39/65. * Monique Honaman at Incite is Donna’s client. It may be best to just refer Doug to Monique. You may want to ask Donna. * J&J used to have two certified practitioners: Bonita Giedrycz (certified 2007), but she retired. Then there was Cathy Fanning (certified 2006), but I believe she is with a company called Seniority Group LLC now. Many of J&J’s subsidiaries like Mentor and LifeScan have Certified Practitioners, too. However, I’m not sure if they would be able to help main J&J office out or not.",High-A
"Here’s a lead that came into me which I re-assigned to Donna in HubSpot because this person is already in NetSuite as a certified practitioner belonging to the reseller channel.  Donna can you follow up if need be?  Yosuke, why did I get this lead assignment?",High-A
"Yes, I know both Kirsten Melin and Kathryn “Kate” Lee --- I will check with Kim for more details.  Thanks!",High-A
"I didn’t see any notes on this lead that just came in from HubSpot… is there any missing data you can pull to help me know what she wants?  (Also, I’ve actually spoken to this person in the past and she was working with Cynthia Radford via Sue Farmer (one of our UK resellers), but I don’t know why she’s reaching back out to me now. Any notes or background information would be helpful.)",High-A
"I don’t believe there is an opportunity with this gentleman. I’ll reach out to touch base and make certain, but I’d say it does not look at all likely.  I didn’t mark him as an Axon primary contact in NetSuite, though. I’m not sure who/how that got selected. I just wonder if there are other non-practitioners like Mr. Gaze who are in a similar position?  I wonder if there was some sort of query that could be ran to see if any other non-certified practitioners are also set up as AXON contacts ---- maybe Leslie can check for us? She is the Queen of NetSuite.",High-A
I received an Axon migration notification request from a customer named Timothy Gaze. This person is NOT a certified practitioner. He bought a WBBB and the teddy bears last year and that’s it.  You can ignore this person’s request.  The bigger question is how did this person get an Axon notification E-Mail? I thought there was some sort of filter on the NetSuite data to only send this to current certified practitioners.   Copying DC and Ashley just to keep them in the loop.,High-A
"I hope your travels back home went well. I’d also like to say thanks for providing lunch the other day. I apologize that I wasn’t able to eat with everyone due to a conflicting call, but I was able to hobble down the stairs on my crutches to grab a much needed slice or two of pizza that afternoon!  I wanted to follow up and see if we should have Yosuke remove the listings at http://www.herrmannsolutions.com/blog/portfolio-item/herrmann-hbdi-certification-workshops/ for May 17-19 Cert in Atlanta and the TBD Cert. in May for Dallas.  With the REI Cert. in Seattle the first week of May, the Washington DC Cert. in the last week of May and the potential dedicated Cert. in Chicago for PriceWaterhouse Coopers also slated for the last week of May it might be a good idea to remove Dallas and Atlanta options from the calendar. I don’t think we have anyone signed up for those sessions yet anyways.  What do you think?",High-A
"Betsy --- At first I thought these requests would be an easy clean-up task that could help a sales person easily find the correct contact record to put their notes in and save them from having to sift through the multiple records, but Yosuke’s explanation shows me it is not so simple to merge the records. So, I understand now.  I sincerely do appreciate Yosuke’s help and attention to finding a workout around or alternative solution.  Thanks --- let’s have a great week!",High-A
I’ve reached out to this prospect to get more info on his situation. I will bring in Michael to help if needed.,High-A
"Ah, okay. That makes sense. I didn’t know why I got that request from Anita and wasn’t sure how to craft my message to her…   Can we change the auto-align assign alerts to only notify me of anyone with 200+ employees? (unless of course they requested a quote/consultation --- in that case I would want to speak with anyone and everyone)",High-A
"Here’s a prospect for you that is located in Frisco that I re-assigned to you in HubSpot.  This guy took the HBDI in 2010 and wanted to talk to someone at Herrmann about bringing it to his team, but we never were able to connect --- maybe you can circle back with him and provide help.",High-A
Will do… I’ll see if I can trade some T.A.’s to her in exchange for some vacation packages! :),High-A
I just assigned you a non-profit customer called Orleans Public Education Network (O.P.E.N.).  You can reach out to Deirdre and see how those two trial HBDI+Thinking Accelerators they tried out went and find out if you can help her with a another T.A purchase or possibly a workshop.,High-A
"Thanks, Kelli!  I should have 2-3 more applications coming in from Varian in the next week or so and maybe a couple of other folks from other companies, as well.",High-A
"Here’s one to reach out to for a “Hail Mary” pass if you have time tomorrow: gave her numerous options and prices for potential workshop, webinar and TA with Sales leadership and sales team on 03.13.15. she told me they will pass because another part  of company is doing different assessment on 05.19.15.   This has probably a >1% chance of being revived, but hey, you never know!",High-A
Will this affect our clients at all?,High-A

Way to go. Donna!!!,High-A
"This is perfect, Betsy! I love how the Certification program is being referred to as a “partnership” in the .pdf because that’s really what it is.",High-A
"Man, this is awesome! It’s stuff like this that makes me really proud and feel very fortunate to be a part of Herrmann.  Thanks so much for working with MITRE on this, RJ! You’re the best!",High-A
"… and happy birthday to Dorothy, too!",High-A
"That is good news! Thanks for sharing, Jennifer!",High-A
WHOA!  That’s awesome!,High-A
Does anyone have any experience with this?,High-A
"Thanks for the reminder, Brenda!  I totally forgot about this expectation requirement! Should someone remind Donna, though? --- I’m not sure if she does WEBs or not anymore.",High-A
"Great question (and a great response by Zechariah in his reply) --- Here’re my musings:   Whenever I talk to a client or prospect about reinforcement I keep it really simple and easy --- I tell them that every participant that goes through any kind of HBDI Training should get a desk flip ($15.95 each). I’ll even include the attached .PPT deck so they and their folks can learn how to use the desk flip more effectively. I’ll always recommend the Walk-Around pads, too ($17.95 for a 5-pack). These are good to bundle into a Solution Model if you can, too.  Another resource that the practitioner can hand out to thinkers are our wallet sized Job Aid cards* ($58.95 for a 100-pack).",High-A
"Thanks for sharing, Zech: This is perfect for our new expectation to spend 3 hours a week improving --- I like watching stuff a lot more than I like reading stuff!",High-A
"Thanks, Yosuke ---- where on the marketing landing page is this? Could you send the exact URL so I can go right to it?",High-A
"This lead is for Medtronic which has headquarters in Ireland has 80,000 employees worldwide. The person that wrote in is based in Minnesota.  So who should this lead actually belong to? Brenda, Sarah or me?",High-A
"Oh, yeah! Anne Griswold is top-notch! I’d love to have her do it, too!  Anne is really good at asking framing why WBT is important for every aspect of your business. She “makes the case” so to speak.",High-A
"Looks good… My only suggestion would be to rephrase the bullet-point: “Coordinate a 2-hr debrief webinar with a Master Practitioner.” ---- I think we can do the intro to WBT, break down the HBDI en masse and pitch them on partnering with us all in one hour. I think two hours is too much/too long. I think the only “Master” Practitioners” in the U.S. are Chuck, Cynthia, Anthony and Ann herself. (I think Curtis Curry might be one, too.) However, I think Ann or Karim (possibly even reaching out to Kevin Sensing*) would be the best picks as not only are they adept at teaching the WBT stuff, but they can also “sell Herrmann” for us, too.  Just my thoughts for what they’re worth.",High-A
Forget that story! Did you know the Lake Lure office is closed today? And did you know the cops came out yesterday??  Craziness was afoot!,High-A
"Good question. My answer: I don't believe David really saw a 38% - 63% split. I think he was mis-seeing"" it.",High-A
"I looked at all the profiles in his Practicum Folder in HTMS and there were a couple of 38/62 splits, but no 38/63 ones.",High-A
"Can he provide the name of the person who he says got a 38% - 63% split?""",High-A
"Yes, thanks, Zech!  I never thought of presenting that type of info to an existing client to egg them on to renew a contract or purchase more assessments. It’s a very yellow quadrant way to show blue quadrant info!",High-A
Kara Campbell sent an email requesting the tracking of the corrected profiles that have not arrived at the location by 3/3. They received the wrong profiles on 2/25/16 by Clark's error of putting the wrong label on the wrong box. Clark's did not send the corrected profiles due to waiting to receive profiles back from the other client that received the profiles to eliminate re -printing. The profiles were not shipped back in time. Clark's failed to send corrected profiles to Cintas.,High-A
Happy Monday!  We have a total of 15 applications for this Cert 13 have confirmed at this time and two are tentative.

Happy Monday!  Jim Hess called in today to check about some training materials that he needs to pick up in Asheville. Jim states he stopped by the office a couple of weeks ago to pick up the Whole Brain Business book. He spoke with Quinton and Ashley. They provided him with a book and said he would be contacted by someone soon to discuss the training materials. He has not received a call from anyone.   He provided his phone number: 703-774-4369  Can you please reach out to him ASAP?  Please let me know if you have any questions.,High-A
Happy Thursday!  I will check into it to see what I can find out. I do know that I forwarded the email error along to Leslie to let her know so I will check with her about it.   I will reach out to Marica Smith today to see if she can send me an email with her practicum order.,High-A
Per our Players only call today I’m sending the file attached for you to review and use as a template for your clients. I use this spreadsheet for  tracking  our client progress through the Axon migration transition.  Please provide any feedback it will me be much appreciated.,High-A

So sorry for the delay in responding to below email.  When I went into your database in HTMS I noticed that the group was not set up to take HBDIinteractive that has modules.   Please confirm that Eric is needing to take the HBDIInteractive or HBDI Fundamentals.   This will need to be updated for this Group in the UCB database.  Please let me know if you have any questions.,High-A

So excited for you! I hope you have a wonderful day with your sweet granddaughters!  Love the picture of them :),High-A
Happy Monday!  Thank you for your email below!,High-A
I agree with Kim we should send to AM if they are aligned to a CRM and if not we would handle during our time in service. I also think we need to be sure to add our signature when sending emails from service internally and externally. I am at fault for not doing this but see that it can pose difficulties if there is not a signature added to the email when sending. I think we also need to forward to our own email when a service email comes in so when receiving a response it comes to us directly not to service.   Please let me know what you think :) As always I am open to what works best for everyone.,High-A
Happy Friday!  I have updated CP access for my clients :),High-A

I would say the contact record….does everyone agree?  Please provide your input :),High-A

"I don’t have administrative access to the design review space, but I can get it from Karim if need by. Is this something that needs to happen this week?",High-A
"Can I also get the following images extracted out of your mockup  1. The circle with the arrow pointing right. 2. The background with people milling around from page 3  And what font is the Herrmann International logo on the left written in? Is it a web font that I can use, or should I just treat it as an image? If it’s the second, can I get that image extracted, but without the “ThinkerHub” part, since this is just for the error pages that will apply across the whole site.",High-A
That sounds good. I can do some technical research in parallel if you can send over the list of product names or links on their website to the specific features we are using.,High-A
"I’ll probably need a little more clarity on exactly which hubspot products w’ere using and where any technical documentation for them are. I started to browse their website, but it looks like they’ve got a lot going on, and I couldn’t figure out which specific items we’d use with regards to Axon integration.  I assume when you refer to forms, you’re referring to forms for data that has no operational impact on Axon, and so we have no need to store the form data in the Axon database. If you’re referring to any forms where Axon makes use of that data as well, it’s a tricky proposition, and probably requires a more in depth conversation about what data you want, and how you plan to utilize it.",High-A
"I won¹t be able to get back to the office today, so I¹ll take a look Wednesday.   The file you sent had some formatting issues with it, so I may try to incorporate your changes into the other file.",High-A
"I talked through this more with bowman, and he's pretty sure we have the  latest. He says the progress tracking code was something where you told him  exactly what to add. Here is the exact code in the .fla file  onClipEvent(load) { function do_nav_op() { _root.get_next(); complet=completare; pag_ina=pagina; loadVariablesNum (""""http://htms.hbdi.com/e-learning/completion.php"""", 0,  """"POST""""); } }  I'm not clear how this actually works since I don't see where completare and  pagina come from, but I don't really know flash. I also don't understand how  those two variables get passed along to the completion.php endpoint.  However, I don't really know flash, so maybe this is correct. Can you  confirm?",High-A
I just tried it and it still doesn¹t seem like completion data is working. I clicked through all of the screens in a brand new browser session and I don¹t see any changes to the results.,High-A
Alright the files are in Graphics >> HBDI_Flash_Original >> assets.zip,High-A
Can I temporarily get write access to that folder. That seems like a good place to upload those assets as any.,High-A
They’re also in source control for the HTML5 version of the TA. They aren’t named very intuitively though (i.e. Screen2-9.mp4). I can copy those files somewhere else if need be. Where would you like them?,High-A
"You and I should probably touch base to ensure you’re looking at the latest codebase, since we had to make some minor modifications to incorporate into the axon application. Just give me a call when convenient.",High-A
"Yes this is separate from the on-going Hurix work, thought this is something they also did. I’m not sure if from a contractual perspective they were linked, or anything like that.  One thing to note, is that most of the issues are tied to video files and their behavior. The muffled audio is only appearing on screens where the audio is part of a video track and the audio that is playing when the application is supposed to be muted, is that same audio. I’m not sure how these video files were generated/extracted from the flash, but that may be part of the issue.",High-A
How does the current flash version handle long names. Do you know?,High-A
"That does sound reasonable to me. We might want to test on IE 9 too, since that’s our lowest targeted browser these days I think. https://www.modern.ie/en-us is good for that, they have VMs with every major version of IE so you can try older versions.",High-A
"Yeah I think so.  They’re trying to talk to the web services on hbdi.biz, but they can’t because it’s a cross site origin request. They want to put the website code on hbdi.biz so they can test the web service interaction. This kind of gets at the issues we talked about though where we don’t really want them to go down this path or get access to hbdi.biz because we’re going to target axon anyways.",High-A
That’s fine unless you have another suggestion.,High-A
"Unfortunately, next week is pretty bad for me. I’m in cert Monday – Wed. We can’t win huh?  Are you coming in for the HAT meeting? Maybe we can just connect then.",High-A
"Do you want to shoot for 1pm today?  Sorry for the late response, had a busy morning.",High-A
"No worries, I’m from Atlanta originally, so I’m used to bad weather totally shutting things down. We can meet then.",High-A
"I have a call at 2:00pm tomorrow, so I pushed this up a little bit, let me know if that’s a problem.",High-A
"With the weather tomorrow, we may want to put this off until Tuesday. Same time then?  As for location, one of the other coders I know here said that the Enka campus at AB Tech actually has some space open to the public that he likes to use. It’s in one of the buildings at their BASE facility http://www.abtech.edu/base. I am still trying to get clear one which one, but does that sound like a good idea to you? It seems like it might be a better fit for digging in than a coffee shop.",High-A
"Monday sounds great. Were you thinking we do a working code session, to dig into what’s already there, or do you have another format in mind?   I’m pretty much free all day.",High-A
"No problem, thanks for letting me know.",High-A
I still haven’t gotten a login link,High-A
I haven’t received a Zenefit login yet. I didn’t attend yesterday though and was planning to attend today. Should I have received one even if I haven’t attended yet?,High-A
I have a 401K from an old employer I’d like to rollover into Herrmann’s plan. Can you provide me with the necessary paperwork to make that happen? Thanks.,High-A
"Ultimately, as Axon does more and more, we’ll probably run into that issue eventually. What we probably have to do long term with that kind of data is have Axon continue to serve the actual form, but have it push some of the data into Hubspot via an API in the background. That way Axon can continue to track and manage the data it needs to operate, but relevant activity data is duplicated, formatted, and pushed into the space where it can be relevant to you and your team.",High-A
Just checking in on v. 1.0 of email signature & letterhead that was due yesterday and today v2.0 is due. Is it in google folder for Christina to edit and give feedback on today?,High-A
"The excel sheet is in the google drive for the overall big pic timeline. Sharing is done through google driveIf you want to use design space, let's bring that up in the meeting on Friday...especially if that's easier.",High-A
"Hi Chris, for the upcoming webinar, Yosuke will be sending you the list of current registrants. See below for the both of you to work out.",High-A
Perfect! Thanks Chris! All is well and hope the same for you,High-A
"Hi Ann, Also, should I move the below to next week, unless you prefer otherwise:  Drafting and sending HAT meeting email to the team (will move from Friday to Monday?) Review JT Reseller info Review HBDI Master Facilitator applications(Tracy Austin call is on Mon., 11/9 so should I reschedule since you have not had time to review?)

"Hi Christina, See below in blue highlight. Can Judith help with this? Thanks so much. This is so we can reprioritize and add in the white paper on comparing assessments:)",High-A
"Hi Shanna, I received your email about not being able to do the 121 tomorrow at 11a ET. I’ve rescheduled for 1p ET tomorrow. It was unclear in the email if you were proposing ET or MT. I always try to include timezone in my responses. I will seek clarification from you moving forward, just to make sure:) so it doesn’t cause you any angst.  Ann, FYI only. I moved your Rackspace call with Andrew and Dorothy to Thursday to accommodate this change.",High-A
"Hi Yosuke, I look forward to talking with you on Friday! See below in yellow to add to the LEAD landing page and provide Ann explanation on the diversity cheat sheet.",High-A
"Both A/B are ready for review and proofing in Hubspot. Note that we need to add hyperlink onto the Inclusive webinar. I don’t see it on our website so I was unable to include the link. Once those edits are made (by Yosuke), it can be scheduled to deploy for US and a list added to both variations.  (cc’d Victoria for UK)",High-A
Reminder due today. Hope you are doing better!,High-A
Here ya go. See attached.,High-A
"Just checking in back in to see if I should still be focused on this project. If so, who is the POC that will be stepping in for Christina?",High-A
"Hi Christina, Hope your day is off to a great start… just checking in to make sure we will have pdf ready by noon:)",High-A
"Here is the update. For those in red what are good estimates for revised timelines. Should we start with those in red, with deadlines start this week or next? I just want to make sure we keep moving forward.   Thank you so much for your input.",High-A
Just checking back in on this:),High-A
"It’s ideal if you can provide me two files both with signatures included – one for hard copy and one for soft copy(ready for upload to Hubspot-this is how we worked it last year with our contracted designer). Here is what the image file looks like, thus far. I need your signature too:)",High-A
Thank you Ladies! Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!,High-A
"Thanks Christina, I’m glad that we are agreeing to have a goal of 5 per week, a much more realistic plan.",High-A
"Dorothy, I spoke with Brenda this afternoon. Could you send us the most recent doc so that you, Ann and Brenda are working off from the same info. Thank you so much!",High-A
"Hi Karim, I’m unable to view specifics on your calendar since I don’t have permissions to view. I went to Bill’s calendar and for the Tues., 8/25 11a meeting it looks like this is set up by Tracy and Ann is not included on these weekly invites. Should she be? I’m including Ann on this in case she has discussed with Bill.  The other meeting on that same day is the monthly check in with you, Ann and Bill. Should we keep these on the calendar?",High-A
"I submitted this via your design space portal, but the portal would not allow me to upload the attached file. So, I’m attaching and including the same detail I put in the portal request:)  We will need 2 mocks up for Betsy (cc: Jennifer) to review for our 1/4 ad for the ATD Conference. The ad will need to include this info:   ·         Title: New Problems, New Thinking: Harnessing Thinking Diversity for Results ·         Speaker: Ann Herrmann-Nehdi ·         Include logo, tagline and website ·         Date/Time: Tuesday, May 24, 3p-4p",High-A
"Bethany, can you make any edits attached for the team? I have a call with Germany with Ann that got bumped that I need to join in 4 minutes.   Shanna, can you send out a new GTM line for Bethany and Sarah to join in on?",High-A
"Hi Shanna, I sent an invite for 1p ET tomorrow.  Were you, Bethany and Sarah able to work on the HAT meeting recommendations that is due Wed? Sorry I couldn't join, had a call with Germany with Ann.",High-A
Attached and thank you.,High-A
I hope you are having a great weekend! I’m just checking in on the below. The first 3 are past due on redesign and here are the next 3 due this week. Let me know if you have any obstacle that we can help to remove.,High-A
Got it. We have other contractors that are being included so we didn’t want to exclude without asking first..,High-A
Thank you. I am aware of that I'm not eligible I just wanted to make sure that it's cancelled on your side so payroll deductions discontinue effective 2/1.,High-A
"Hi Shanna, There doesn’t appear to be any conflicts and it gives staff opportunity to attend at least session.  Hi Ann, Should I send out the invites the team?",High-A
Just checking back on this:) Will below date work for you?,High-A
"Julie may have open slots for breakouts. I’m on the phone with Ann and she suggests we put her name in and swap out at last minute, once we get someone lined up.  Attached are the sessions. Ann is thinking the first, but we would need to find a replacement. This is not a new session. Julie needs answer quickly.",High-A
"Hi Betsy, I see the suggestions below and just checking to see what the final verdict from all is so I can report back to Julie on which session we would like a breakout session for.",High-A
"Got it. So just change the urls to be consistent and once I receive(whatever you think is best aesthetically), I’ll to send to client and cc: Betsy. Thank you Chris!",High-A
"If you haven’t already done so, please see below and send to me by COB, Wed., 6/15. Thank you.",High-A
Got it. Thank you team. Sorry I was not able to join…was tugged in a few different directions:) Hope you have a wonderful day and a very Happy Thanksgiving.,High-A
"It seems to be the best available, most cost effective, non-stop flight for you and Nehdi @$1190 pp, departs from CLT to Paris, either on 9/23 or 9/24 (no change in cost) and returns from Paris to CLT on 10/2.  I also checked prices from CLT to Paris; then, departing from London and the prices are $1600+ per ticket. Do you have budget that we should try to stay in? Which do you prefer:  Round trip to and from Paris? Roughly $1190 pp Or Fly into Paris and depart from London?

"Good morning Chris, Thank you for the update and we will adjust accordingly. Have a happy Thanksgiving!  Good morning Betsy, I’ll revise the case study redesign project timeline and share the updates during our 121 tomorrow.",High-A
Good morning! Just a reminder for below in yellow:),High-A
"The issue is that these individuals are accessing the online ordering system with “old” credentials, these individuals need to be updated. This means that you set them up access under their contact records and remove access from the old customer record. When the order is placed online it is pulling data from the old customer record and not the new contact record. These should be being updated each time an online order comes in that requires the AM team to update any information once it is flipped to a contact. I am pulling a list of all clients that have placed an order in the last year, hopefully this will help us to determine who these problem children are….",High-A
"Kim – I am beginning to get very concerned about this issue. The only ones that we seem to be having challenges with this issue are your clients – once the record is created the first time it should not be an issue. When someone places an order online and you notice the account is not right, we should be setting up their access under their contact record and adding the account.   Do we need to schedule sometime to revisit this?",High-A
"Thank you Joe for coming to the rescue! Lake Lure staff, please feel free to come into the office to work on Thursday!!!",High-A
Did you handle this or should I login and do something? :),High-A
"I assume you are receiving these emails too, right? Should I continue to forward? I don’t want to clutter up your inbox :)",High-A
No its fine I can disregard I just didn’t want to be forwarding them to you so you end up with two copies! I wont send anymore :),High-A
"Our banker has asked us to provide our “new” insurance information. I received an email from Webb Insurance (Liability) that we were changing policies back in November – I sent the note over to you to verify this change, but did not hear back, and it fell off my radar. Did you make changes to our liability insurance either the policy or the broker? Can you provide any information you have in regards to this?  Also – as I mentioned last week I need to schedule a 1-2-1 for us this week to connect on what projects you have on your plate, entry work, and “new” items we need your help with – can you provide any times that work well for you?  Hope you are recovering well from your surgery!",High-A
Can we talk about the below one day this week? We need to get this finalized and the process documented!,High-A
"Maybe Shanna? could draft an email to the office and let them know that the 401K enrollment options have changed and that now you can enroll at any time, once it is a done deal of course! We should add the 401K to the benefits at a glance for new hires, and I can handle those forms as Bryan gave me a stack yesterday while here….  As for the compliance testing Shanna – this is why we do a Safe Harbor contribution, because our plan is top heavy. We are covered with the Safe Harbor contribution, it is still a fantastic benefit and we should encourage participation by the team!",High-A
He mentioned the enrollment dates yesterday but no one flinched – maybe they didn’t quite understand….it did not turn into a discussion.,High-A
"Well the two that were interested in the first meeting hand delivered them to me so if you just want to send what you get along I will handle and we will update the “new hires” that it should be me…. I need your help with lots of other stuff, this I can take care of!  Thank you!!!",High-A
No worries….I can do tomorrow up until 11am eastern and then I am open from 4-5 OR I can do Friday from 11-1. This has been an insane week for me with meetings. I am in an all afternoon 12-5 meeting today.  If neither of these times work we can reschedule for next week – just let me know what days are Herrmann days!,High-A
No worries – I just want to make sure you have everything you need from me to get this finalized. I am sure this will all calm down once we make it through open enrollment :),High-A
Hold on Joe’s offer letter. I will connect with him and confirm the offer amount.   I didn’t know about Joe until right before you were looped in to move forward with the hire….I was under the impression that Dorothy was aware that IT was moving back to operations which reports to me.,High-A
"Thanks for the update! For scheduling purposes I am out of the office on Thursday this week, chaperoning a field trip with my son.",High-A
I will attend to make sure I am understanding correctly but as of right now I don’t believe the rule change will significantly impact us because our salaried staff are above the threshold range and our hourly paid are below….,High-A
Thanks Shanna! I knew you would handle it :),High-A
I am not sure why we went to bi-annually instead of anytime. I do think some of it has to do with managing “new enrollees” but that shouldn’t be terribly time consuming for a company our size.  Bryan Edwards did this training at our request – with Shanna and I both new to the 401K administration this is a detail that was either unknown or overlooked. I do think he should have reminded us of our enrollment dates since we just passed it and were requesting training.   I think if we have employees that want to join (and I know of at least 2 from yesterday’s session) we should change our options to allow them to join.  Shanna – did I miss anything?,High-A
"Well the two that were interested in the first meeting hand delivered them to me so if you just want to send what you get along I will handle and we will update the “new hires” that it should be me…. I need your help with lots of other stuff, this I can take care of!",High-A
I sent her a text message but I think the below is correct :)  Will let you know what I hear…..,High-A
Can you cancel the rental car reservation? We did that one for her as we needed to prepay.,High-A
If this time works for you DSG would like to discuss what the plan of attack is for the design and to see what all pieces you are handling vs what we need from them. I am not sure about this part of the project and all the steps so your input will be valuable in preparing them for how much time I am going to need from them. Can you do this 30 min check in call with us?  Thanks so much!,High-A
Great! Here should be everything you need!  Email: anne.griswold@hbdi.com Bio: Attached Pic: Attached,High-A
"I need to make a change to the Certification Hub created by you & Tracy.   We need to remove Tracy as the practitioner coach and add Anne Griswold. I am happy to do this, but do not have the proper access to be able to manage this portal…can you help either give me access or update the page?",High-A
Please disregard….I was able to correct the form!,High-A
"I renewed the form from 123forms, but apparently this is still not working. Are you comfortable sharing the admin credentials for the cert hub with me? I don’t feel like anyone is managing this at the moment, and while we need to get away from it completely, there are still numerous practitioners using this site.",High-A

We’ve been chatting about Inbound marketing. We do 2 webinars per year @ $5k per webinar last year and this year.,High-B
"I hope all is well. I’m helping to coordinate some activities for the upcoming ATD 2016 conference and wanted to get with you to see if you are attending. If so, I wanted to see if you’re willing/able to shoot some client testimonial videos during the reception Tuesday evening.  I can provide the list of interview questions and work with you on the requirements for the audio/video equipment. If you’re not attending, I’ll come up with a back-up plan.  Thanks!",High-B
"How goes it? Val mentioned that you’re out next week, so I wanted to sync on the timing of the next round of emails we send for the Axon Migration. I have 253 of your Axon primary contacts who haven’t responded, so we’re going to send it from you.   Here’s the list view: https://app.hubspot.com/sales/1697019/contacts/view/224388/   Two questions:  1. When would you like me to send it? I’m thinking towards the end of next week, but would understand sending after you get back so you get caught up. 2. Would you like to draft the email? I have a generic email that gives the deadline and stuff, but since you’ve had numerous conversations w/ clients, you might be able to hit the mark.  Let me know your thoughts.",High-B
"We got the final scope and go-ahead to move forward with the list of assets for the Diversity of Thought Toolkit. I invited you to the Basecamp project where you can see the list of deliverables assigned to you https://basecamp.com/2609693/projects/8362831/todolists/38197553  Feel free to add comments, ask questions, and check off the to-do items once they’re complete.",High-B
"Just as an FYI, I set up the workflows so that leads w/ existing contact owners will notify the contact owner. This should keep them from being reassigned. Let me know if you come across any that don’t.",High-B
"Thank you for your patience and follow-up. It appears that you somehow requested a consultation from an old web form so it didn’t get to me.  I’d be happy to connect you with someone as soon as possible. Would you mind providing the answers to some of these questions:  * What country are you based in? If you’re in the US, can you tell me what state? * Is this for your business or are you with a company that uses it internally? If you’re with a company, can you give me the number of employees?  Thanks again for following up with us.",High-B
"Yes, I did have a wonderful weekend. I also had a chance to set up and play with the PandaDoc integration. It was pretty easy to use and once the templates are set up, it only takes a few mins to populate the right contact/company fields.  The pdf is attached as well. I also sent you the email from the system, but I’ll have to see how to make it so it doesn’t require login.",High-B
"As we’re refreshing all the case studies, we may want to fix the typo for Sotheby’s in the list of clients as Karim requested. There’s also a Sobeys in Netsuite, so we may want to check w/ Karim.",High-B

I have the field mapped in the Company record. Can you give me the names of the 9 companies that have this check box checked?,High-B
"Thanks for reaching out. It’s great to virtually meet you.  It would be great to connect to go over your on-boarding and how you can start adding value ASAP.  We created some of the customer personas for resellers and direct clients for various HR functions (see attached). My VOC interview questions will revolve around their thinking, interests and objections throughout the customer journey.   I’ll follow up with an invite for Wednesday that works for you. I’m looking forward to it!",High-B
"Sorry Q, I didn’t update the rule for this contact us form for resellers. It assigned it to you when it should have been Donna. Donna, can you follow up?",High-B
Here’s a lead from Venezuela who selected Canada as the country. Can you (or Donna?) help this gentleman?   Is the standard protocol for anyone in South America to go to you?,High-B
Sure! I’ll give you a call then.,High-B
"Here’s the proof of the email that has the updates made to the survey form. I’ll send it to the list of all resellers once you give the green light.  JT – Yes, we can send an automated email w/ the agenda once they register for the call as well as in the meeting invite. Want to send it over so I can set it up?",High-B
"Here is a review of what we went over on the phone and an update about the rep change. The company name field is causing some issues with creating leads in NetSuite. The two options to fix this are to make a default company name in Bedrock or to make this field required on the contact in HubSpot.     Here are some other quick fixes that need to be made to the select fields are:     - Category field in HubSpot does not have Reseller as option so contacts from Netsuite with this are failing ot write - Subsidiary field in HubSpot does not have Herrmann UK Ltd. as an option  - Netsuite looking for values for following fields on some attempts to create or update contacts - Current Database, Contact Category and Practitioner Status - Your Role in HubSpot is missing Other as an option so contacts in Netsuite with this option are failing",High-B

I sent the updated spreadsheet last month with those numbers (see attached). I also attached the numbers for Inbound calls.  I’m testing out a workflow to auto-assign the leads where states and employee size fields are known. Would you happen to have all the lists you can send me for each event?,High-B
"I’m wondering what your thoughts are on creating a questionnaire that has existing resellers submit 1) their area of expertise (I.e. Leadership Development, OD, Sales Training, D&I, etc.) as well as verticals so that we can automatically create lists.   This can help support your outreach to resellers while providing lists of resellers who specialize in specific areas. Here’s a mock-up of what the form could look like.",High-B

It is now a part of my DNA and has made a difference in many areas of my life.  I will never forget all of the wonderful people on the team I have worked and partnered with.

You're welcome. Yes it will be or at least provide a date we'll have it completed by. Will need to reconfirm in regards to the first classes for leaders can it be the current version until it is completed. Having the new look of the portal is a first good faith forward. 508 compliance will also be important.   I kept the virtual cert high level but they will want date in that also.,High-B
"First of all, please know I am sending this discussion document so you have information prior to the call tomorrow and for our reference.  My intent is not for you to read this on the weekend, as I’d like to honor non-work time.  My apologies I did not get this to you Friday, however was back to back calls from 8-4pm.  Dorothy, I’m not sure you are able to join, however now that I recapped the notes and there are items regarding Axon and privacy on the survey it would be good if you could join.

The session on the 15th will be a ½ day session.  Thank you, Curtis, for doing a great delivery and having impact to take it to the next step.

"Thanks.  I have meetings tomorrow and Thursday (pretty full), however have open time on Friday if that works for you.  Or is it something we can cover on the Monday ibm call?  Or did you prefer to talk separately?",High-B
"LOVE it and thank you so much.  It worked.  I clicked link to do TA and was able to log on, just so can show seamlessness.  I’ll watch for new link tomorrow.  Thanks again for all you’ve done on this and the partnership!",High-B
"Thanks, Bowman, for the below.  Am I understanding you correctly, that in looking at the below info in your email, we could be compliant fairly easily or begin the process for it?  I have not answered IBM yet on this as I want to ensure to provide the most accurate information and so as to put us off their list of development available to use.  Could we discuss on a call Monday as my meeting with them is on Tuesday (I shared with Rich we could discuss in the meeting versus me emailing the info).  He was open to that.  It bought us a little time.",High-B
"Welcome, Dominic, and looking forward to having you join the HI team!  Randi Jo, it has truly been a great experience working with you and wishing you the best in your future opportunity!",High-B
"OMGoodness!!!  I LOVE it!  Thanks so much.  Agree will not position will be similar for future clients.  With being in cert tomorrow and then travel for rest of evening, Monday is only day I have for a walk through.  How do any of the times look for you?  9-10am eastern 1-1:45pm 3:30-5pm  Just let me know and I’ll set up the meeting.  Thanks.  I’ll feel out ibm during the meeting on it.  If it’s a deal breaker, I’ll let you know Karim.",High-B
"Thanks so much, Leslie, for letting us know.",High-B
"Congrats, RJ!",High-B
Ok.  I’ll set up a gtm in case we need to look at the portals together - visually,High-B
Is someone setting up the conference call or do you prefer I set it up.  Fine with either.,High-B
Sure.  I’m open the following times Eastern:  Between 8:30am-11:30am  Between 2-5pm,High-B
"I’d like to make sure we’re all on the same page and we’ve made the business case before proceeding with ThinkerHub or Thinker Hub. My questions are:  1. Has this been discussed and a decision reached to trademark this name, and are we planning to stick with this particular name? Up to now, I have heard ThinkerHub referred to as a place holder. Keep in mind, each filing runs several thousand dollars and I am not sure what our budget for 2015 is yet.  2. Is this the intended name for HI’s use, or is this only being used for a specific client?  3. In which countries do we intend to use this? I must supply that information to Sheri at Altera before we can proceed.  In addition, Sheri will have to do the official search of this term before we can go forward.  Please take a moment to read over these and think about if this is the direction we’d like to go before we incur the expense to start the process.  Ann, John and Karim, I’d like to have your approval before proceeding.  Thanks!!",High-B
"Sorry to bug you…Karim and the Global team are asking for the call and these slides. Were you able to post them yet, and if so, can you provide the link?",High-B
I sent to both of you only because I had heard Bowman was in an accident and had surgery and not sure who would handle these types of requests.  Sorry for the confusion.,High-B
This is perfect! Thank you!,High-B
Thanks so much for the quick action!,High-B
Time does fly when you're having fun! Thanks everyone for a great year. I'm looking forward to many more with my awesome colleagues!,High-B
Thanks Bowman…dumb question…how do I get to WordPress? Is there a link from our intranet?,High-B
Is there a hyperlink we should use when changing our signatures from “pre-order the book” to “buy the book”? It would be nice to be able to link the buyer directly to the best source to purchase the book.,High-B
"If you have not had a chance to take the survey, please click the “click here” phrase below to access the web site. If you have taken it, thanks for your participation, no further action is needed. I would like to gather up the results by Thursday of this week.  Thanks so much for your assistance!",High-B
"I'm forwarding to our IT folks, as they would have to give you that access. I'm not able to provide it.",High-B
"Thanks, just to verify, the people in our global offices have logins to this site?",High-B
"The one you told me to use, and sent you a follow up email saying it said it was uploading. Did you not receive it at all, or could it  be in a spam folder? I sent it immediately after you replied to me.",High-B
"Is this posted now? Is it password protected, or secured in any way? I’d like to send the global team the link.",High-B
"Thanks, I’m sending now!",High-B
"Not sure whom to ask, but hoping for some help locating an editable version of the Coca-Cola case study. I have searched all of the drives I have access to and cannot find it.   If anyone has access to it, would you kindly send me a copy so I can satisfy Hanna’s request below? Thanks so much and have a great day!",High-B
"I’m including Bowman on this correspondence, as I believe he would have to assign you an access password to the intranet.   I don’t know that you will have editing rights however. If you have changes, you can send them to me and I’ll change the list and have Bowman post it. I know it’s not exactly the best method, but we are currently working to find a better solution for sharing for all of the global team and Herrmann corporate.  I’ll provide updates on our progress and when we will implement a new platform for communications so stay tuned!",High-B
Great job RJ! Congrats!,High-B
Welcome! I'm looking forward to working with you Yosuke.,High-B
Ok..so that’s a little trickier…I think that profile is in the Sandbox.  I’ll need to re-enter it into Production.  I’ve added it to my calendar for this afternoon after Sprint planning,High-B
Happy Friday and Happy Labor Day Weekend.  Thanks to the Axon Team for more Progress for us and for our Clients!  Kudos to Andrew and Jake for the techno-magic!  Today we updated the Axon Server and made some significant improvements.  The easy way you can tell if you are seeing the updates is to look for new Announcements on the Dashboard when you sign in.  We switch the Servers over and it takes a little time for everyone to see the new stuff depending on Internet Servers around the world.  #1 You may have experienced some “slowness” and maybe some time out issues.  We have made some additional improvements…this will be especially true for Clients.  (We are working on some ideas to help with our internal searches since we have access to so much data…more to come on that!)  #2 Emails from Axon have been “SCRUBBED” for possible spam filter issues.  Should perform even better from the Axon email server now.,High-B
Attached is a PDF of screen shots of the Thinking Accelerator.  This “might” help you find things…but it is screen shots of pics so the text isn’t copy-able.  I’ve reached out to the Hurix Team again…I needed to anyway…I was expecting the last installment of corrections.  So I’ve asked if they can “extract” the text in a use-able format.  We’ll see what they say.  I’m still trying to think of other places we can pull the text from.  There is the Booklet for the HBDI of course….but it doesn’t have “everything”  I’ll keep looking.,High-B
Super…can we avoid Mondays if possible?,High-B
I’m not free on Mondays until after 12:00 as a general rule. Could we do this later in the day?,High-B
You should have it now…you have 12 hours to reset your password…these requests do expire.,High-B
Let’s go for it!    I would love to live in a simplified world!  Thanks Betsy!  Sounds like we have new opportunities with Hub Spot!,High-B
Please see my response and the attached to Victoria’s request for a copy of her original job description.  Just wanted you to be aware of her request.,High-B
"Wouldn’t it be great if no matter where you are in the world* you could submit a “ticket” when you need IT support from Herrmann?  Your wait is over! Check out this page:  http://support1.hbdi.com/  You will want to save this page as a favorite.  Then anytime you need help, just fill in all the information you can on this page, and it will automatically alert Paul to your need.  This system allows you to ask for help AND follow-up on requests. It also helps us determine where the challenges are happening most often, and track the time it takes to solve the challenges.  Check it out!",High-B
If you are wondering about your 401K in this “interesting” time…here is an email from our 401K Counsel at First Citizens.  I thought you might be interested….  See below and attached.,High-B
Gosh Bowman! Are you ok?  Do you need anything?  How badly are you broken?  Life is certainly full of surprises!,High-B
It looks like you might have a window at 2pm today.  I can make that work if that’s better for you.,High-B
"I wasn’t sure if you would be able to attend, but I did want you to know that this will be happening  :)",High-B
I’ll make Friday work…no matter what.  It would be great to have any ideas from them in advance so I could prepare with some possible responses or plans to better our security stance.,High-B
"I have prepared the documents and I will be sending them over in just a bit.  I realize it is late in the day, sorry but I had another Client urgent request come in this afternoon.  I will sending the files by our secure system called DatAnywhere/Varonis.  Please let me know if you do not receive the files.",High-B
I’ll do all in my power to finish this today.,High-B
I was on vacation yesterday.  I did send in the requested email to sign up for FSA.  Did you not receive it?  I’ll send again.,High-B
I search everywhere for over an hour.  Turns out her email address wasn’t correct in the Zenefits site.  Leslie has just updated it.,High-B
Just saw your email from this morning.  I’ll try to get into Kim’s email.  Give me a few minutes.,High-B
"I do not have many of the Role Matrices…there was an initiative about 18 months ago to get everyone’s matrix developed, but they were not sent to me…I believe they were sent to John, and the ones I do have are quite old…one for Paul, one for me (pre-Axon) and one for Laura Wang…none relevant to today’s Herrmann world.  I’ve attached the Job Descriptions we’ve put together over the past couple of years.  But you may need to reach out to each Leadership team member to get more info.  Or I can try to dig into email archives, but that could take a bit of time.",High-B
Thanks for enrolling me in the FSA plan for $750 for the 2016 plan year.  I’ve noted the info in your email below too.,High-B
I’d be happy to help if I could but this is where Shanna Lelli can help you best.  I’ve copied Shanna on this response in hopes she will be able to help you.,High-B
We’ve had two more good interviews with Joe Chronister and I’m ready to move forward with Reference checks.  Please see his references below.  I’m hoping I can schedule a meeting for Joe here in Lake Lure and with Ann very soon.  Would you be able to check out his references this week if you can reach these folks?  See below,High-B
"Missing work and trying to deal with the issues around the consequences of that would probably push me way over the edge.  So no I’ve pushed myself to be here in the office everyday…and many days lately have been 10-12-14 hour days…at the office and then at home.  Physical ramifications…yes…all classic symptoms of stress…stomach issues, headaches, arrhythmia, but nothing that has been so bad that it exceeds my fear of letting things get worse by not being here.  I don’t want it to get that bad…that’s why I’m interested in getting help now, before I breakdown…  I have made an appointment with a Psychologist, but I didn’t ask about WC…didn’t know if was even an option.",High-B
"I have a more direct question regarding my personal situation…If I see a psychologist to help me deal with stress at work, is that considered covered under worker’s comp?",High-B
Based on this week’s needs we could be a bit premature in moving him to part-time as of 1-1-16  Do we have a time frame in which this must be done?  He has essentially agreed to be PRN for me…but I don’t know what that looks like from day to day just yet.  I am really struggling with being without his help and I don’t want to do anything to jeopardize that or to make a change and then he ends up having to work 35 hours this week…just to help me out.  We are experiencing the murphy law this week.  Computers dyeing etc.  I’m hoping the dust settles soon and that we have a replacement soon too.  When we have a replacement that could be another “full” week of work for Paul to onboard him with all the systems we have in place.  I do have a few references for one of the Paul replacement applicants that I’d like you to check out for me.  I’ll send them along shortly.,High-B
"On a side note, I’ve spoken to Ann, but I might need a little HR ear too.  I am drowning in the sea of stress and struggling to keep above water.  I have never been so stressed out her in all my years.  I might need an ear or some other options if you know what I might have available to me…from a company stand point.",High-B
He and I are going to discuss tomorrow.  He still hasn’t gotten an answer about his PTO and if we’d pay him for the days he “earned” in 2015 that he would normally take in 2016.  He did suggest that we could extend his end date into 2016 and he could help onboard the replacement if that meant he could get his time.  I could really use his help in training up the new person…when I find them!,High-B
I can check with her to see if she wants someone else to do the enrollment…  but I think first she just wants enough info to say “I’ll stick with whatever is closest to what I have.”   She just doesn’t have the capacity to compare and contrast right now.,High-B
I asked if she remembered what type plan she has now…that we might be able to suggest the plan that is closest to that one.  She couldn’t even remember.  But that might help.,High-B
"Not real sure how to handle this one.  I do not believe there is a chance for future business here.  Dominic was unpleased last time I charged for an individual assessment stating we don’t do B2C business.  I’m guessing I should turn this over to a practitioner in Nebraska? Normally I would just use the following template, but I’m not looking to get in trouble for using it?  What are your thoughts?",High-B
"This is probably one of those things you can help me with to keep off of Bethany’s plate.  This came in as a lead, but how would she have purchased an assessment online?  I’m missing something here.",High-B
Attached is my FSA enrollment.  Thank you!  Also I’m assuming I can spend my FSA money on my kids even if they are not on my plan correct?  Also I don’t have the insurance premium information to complete on the form so I left it blank.,High-B
I have already contacted all of my leads.  I’m sorry I was responding as they were coming in.  I did my initial email response and planned to follow up via phone tomorrow if the number was listed (most are not).  I’d prefer to respond personally to all of them if that is a possibility.,High-B
"Do you know who this is?  I don’t recognize the name.  I looked him up in Axon, but all the people with that name have older profiles.  This one was completed today.",High-B
"I was hoping you could help me with this piece.    They are going to be buying two TA’s from us for $150 each before buying the next 14 at $250.  How do I go about getting this set up for them?  Not sure if we just provide a link and bill later or how that works.  Also my document I have is for the HBDI and Fundamentals and not for the TA.    Thanks for your help, and excuse the ignorance.  First one like this…",High-B
"Thanks for getting back to me.  I’m glad to see I’m the first!  I agree with your assessment of the professional networker, but I’m okay with that label.  Everyone that goes to these events are there to promote themselves, their business, or both.  I think the only thing that offends people when it comes to networking has to do with how they network, not that they are networking.  If one person recognizes our logo from across the room, and strikes up a conversation then I think it is worth it.    Since we don’t have one already made up, I’m happy to just use our logo off the marketing landing page and have one created.  Up to you, I just didn’t want to step into your arena without permission.    Thanks as always!",High-B
Big thumbs up.  Thank you as always!,High-B
"Attached is your profile code.  Thank you for the time this morning.  Please let me know when you have had time to review, and we can take a deeper dive.    A few items that may be of interest due to your involvement in simulation training:  The first is called the thinking accelerator which is an automated tool that provides the assessment, model overview,  and debrief combined into an online tool.  The other is a really fun tool we call the text profiler.  The short explanation is that it is a tool that allows you to input text, and it will provide an analysis of how balanced it is towards each quadrant we discussed.  Our practitioners are using the tool to make sure their training material is geared for all types of thinkers so that it is better received.    Looking forward to our next talk.",High-B
Calendar update has been sent.  Talk to you this afternoon.,High-B
Thank you for taking the time to help me understand what you are trying to accomplish through the use of Whole Brain thinking.  Attached you will find the document we discussed with instructions on how to access the assessment.  Once I get the results back we can schedule your debrief.  From there we can look at how to proceed with the rest of your team.  If you have any questions please just let me know.    I’m looking forward to working with you!,High-B
Certainly.  I already have a 2:30 scheduled. Would 3:30 central work for you?,High-B
"Wednesday the 4th at 1:00 would be perfect.  I’ll follow up this email with a calendar invite.  The meeting will be a “zoom” meeting which offers video chat, and the ability to share our screens.  If you are able to download the app prior to our meeting that would be great.  If not, you are welcome to simply dial in on the number provided in the email.  I look forward to meeting you.  Enjoy your time off this week, and happy new year.",High-B
"I have a call scheduled with Anne tomorrow to practice and go over schedule.  Can you clarify your email.  I read it as:  If she is available have her come in to Dallas for the meeting, and if not then rehearse with her prior to the meeting.  I just want to make sure I’m on the same page that you are on.",High-B
I’ll wait to hear from you before I go back to Rana.  I want to make sure I have everything that is needed to cut down on the back and forth with her.,High-B
"Ashley sent out an update yesterday, and I hope your counts are rebounding.  If you are up to it, I would love your input on this clients question.  I know this isn’t an earth shattering deal, but I’m sure it is a scenario that will repeat itself often here at Herrmann.    For a quick refresher.  JT sat in on this qualifying call with me a few months back.  They were exposed to Whole Brain through a reseller, and due to the growth Matt was inquiring about certification so that he could expand the program throughout the organization. He went ghost on me for a few months, but seemed to re-engage 2 weeks ago in response to my request to have him sign up for brainbytes.    My question:  Would you do the Sandler reverse here to make sure the question I think I’m hearing is the one he is actually asking, or simply answer his question since I believe he is prepping the numbers to present to his boss for approval and checking on his own availability.",High-B
"Thank you for the vote of confidence for bringing me into the Herrmann family.  I’m only four days in, but already enjoying the decision to come on board.    I’ve been asked to schedule some time with you to review “Global Team Structure & Dynamics, and “Current Learning & Development Products”.    I’m guessing my schedule is more flexible than yours is right now, but if you can give me two windows of time that would work for you, I’ll make one of them work from my end.    Thank you again!",High-B
"Thank you for the explanation.  I do sincerely want to comply with your orders.    Our meeting with Transamerica you referenced was my second week here on August 17th.  I took notes, but it is certainly possible that at the time I did not know enough about our industry to fully comprehend what you were telling me.    This is what I have from my notes from our Transamerica meeting:  * Understand what business objective they are trying to accomplish. * Understand who is involved in the decision making process. * Understand if a budget has been outlined to accomplish their stated objectives. * Understand the timeline that this will take place over.   Perhaps we can review it again during our focus coaching on Friday?",High-B
"We quoted $185 with no agreement that included the walk around pads and the start thinking workbooks.  She is asking for a pay as you go with only the assessment.  I don’t see the pricing of the workbooks on the pricing sheet so I can’t work back to the number.  However, the walk around pads cost $18 per pack of 5 so. $3.60 plus whatever the workbooks cost.  Do you have a number that you would like me to be at?",High-B
"I just sent the invite.  As for details,  I put everything I know in my original email below. I’ll be on the call to do introductions and kick us off.  If you would like to talk prior to then just let me know  Thank you!",High-B
"So official answer:  4k per library, or all 4 for 12K.   I also asked about team dashboard.  I’ll update as soon as I know more on that.",High-B
Anything ever come from this?,High-B
"Just wanted to follow up with the voicemail I just left.  Can you assist in getting my profile information to Macey?  I’m happy to do it, but not really sure how.  I appreciate your assistance.  Andrea will probably have the same request coming to you if she has not already reached out.",High-B
"I know you are in Lake Lure this week, but was hoping to schedule some time with you to get a better understanding of your role, and how we can best work together.    Would you be available for a call on Monday at 2:00 or Wednesday at 9:00 central?  Please let me know which you would prefer, and if neither works feel free to offer an alternate time.",High-B
I requested the hold.  I'll follow up with the coordinator first thing in the morning.  Talk to you soon.,High-B
"Can you please provide a contact for a reseller that I can send over a request for an individual profile assessment?  This contact is based in Texas, but if you have someone that is willing to do debriefs via phone or video chat then I’ll just use them as a reference going forward.",High-B
"I don’t believe she can do what she is asking until she is on Axon, correct?",High-B
I cancelled due to the chaos at the office.  Stay safe!,High-B
Following up our conversation.  I’m looking for two types of information.    Lists:  Customer purchases (of mine) going back 5 years by year.  Intent is to see who has bought and has stopped buying so I can reach out to them.  Thinkers list of people located in my geographic area going back at least 10 years.  I need to know what company they were with when they took the HBDI and when.  Building on that list or a new list would be my certified practitioners in my geography.    Thank you for your help with this.  If you need further info from me to make this happen please just let me know.,High-B
"Many thanks for your reply.  Doing the individual debriefs with the team members is all part of the team debrief process so that is just fine.  With regards to the meeting with Karim, the 30th July is currently free for him between 9am and 4pm.  Is there any particular time you would like to book the hour in for?  Also would you like to do the call via Go To Meeting or Skype or a phone call?  We are happy to do whichever works best for you – and we can set up the GTM and send you log in details if that is preferred.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",High-B
"Could I please get your advice on how best to deal with the situation below in terms of Netsuite.  Joanna Floyd was at Bain Capital and had booked to attend Cert in September with us.  Bain Capital have already paid the full amount for Cert as they wanted to get it paid before the end of their financial year.    So we have a Netsuite record #2113 for the order confirmation with the payment against that currently.    Should we move this record under Joanna's new client record and mark her Bain Capital one as inactive?  Or should I leave the Bain one there as it has the payment on it and we haven't officially invoiced for it yet, and set up a new one at zero cost against her new record so it shows up as her attending?  I think option 1 would be best but wanted to check with you first.  I hope you can help.",High-B
"Thanks for coming back to me on this and letting us know, I'll update Karim on this news as well so he's aware.  We wish you the best of luck for your last week at Bain Capital and for your next venture, and we look forward to welcoming you onto the course in September!",High-B
"Seeing as Karim just replied to that other email, I’ll run it by him quickly I think, I think he will say yes too, but would rather have that in writing!!",High-B
"Thank you, I can't wait now, just 3 more weeks of work and 5 weeks until the estimated due date - couldn't come soon enough as my body seems to be giving up on me now!",High-B
"Thanks for confirming Christine, please look out for the email from our fulfilment team either later today or tomorrow with the soft copies and the tracking details.  If you have any questions or queries at all please do not hesitate to contact me.",High-B
"Do you mean you have tried to put an entry through or you can’t even see it?  It takes me to the questions, but I haven’t tried to enter anything myself – although Paul did a test and that worked.",High-B
This just came through - I'm guessing it's from you!,High-B
"Thank you Dorothy, that’s perfect.",High-B
"FYI…. It’s a difficult one as I know Bowman and Paul wracked their brains for the best way to have the form show ‘within’ our website as Karim wanted – and this was the only way.  So email responses are the only way.  What do you think?  (By the way, the form is not findable on the website – people will only find it if we share it with them).    When are sure that we are going to use it and we have updated it fully I will replace the Survey Monkey website address on the Pardot redirect so that it will remain the same website address that we send to people – the redirect website address.",High-B
"Many thanks for coming back to me on this I really appreciate it.  I’ve spoken with our Managing Director, Karim Nehdi, and explained the situation to him in full.  He has agreed to sell the support tools to you based on our existing relationship with the BBC and your understanding of the information I gave previously about the games being used in the correct way.    He would also very much like to see you train in our tool when you have the availability next year, so we will keep in touch with you as and when dates for 2015 are published.  As yet we don’t have them in place, however there is usually one in February, one in May, another in September and the final one in November (which is most likely to be held in Paris).  I’ve added you to our mailing list so you can be one of the first to know when we publish our new dates.",High-B
"With regards to the tools, the prices would be as follows:-  Whole Brain Mat: £149 Diversity Game with Expansion Kit: £94 Diversity Game Extra Cards: £30  Please note these prices are subject to VAT and P&P.  We would be able to send them out to you by next working day courier and our cut off time to deliver the next working day is 1pm each working day.  I look forward to hearing from you should you wish to go ahead and place the order.  We have your address as follows from your original enquiry, could you please confirm if this is the correct address for billing and for delivery?  Also if we need to send the invoice to a certain email address or if we require a PO number from you for the order please do let me know.",High-B
"I just had another look and yes I found it, I’ve just noticed that in your first email you’d said her surname was Bertrand, not Bernard – which explains why I couldn’t find it!  It was sent on the 14th October to Sophie originally.  Do you need a new hard copy printed or were you just looking for a soft copy?  I’ve attached a soft copy here for you.",High-B
Could I follow up with you on this?  Have you made any progress?,High-B
"The 1st July would be best if possible as Karim is taking an HBDI session on the 4th.  On the 1st he is currently free anytime except between 2-3pm when he has another call.  Would you like to confirm which time works best for you?  Also I don’t have a telephone number for you on file, could you share that with me, or are you happy for me to set up a Go To Meeting via your computer with Karim?  Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",High-B
"I’ve just heard from Karim to say that he won’t be able to make the call at 11am this morning, so I have pushed the call back to 12:15 instead.  I’ve resent the calendar invitation to you showing this, so if this time works for you could you please accept the invite?  If this doesn’t work for you he is also available between 3-4pm today or is looking quite open for tomorrow.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",High-B
"I’m well thanks I hope you both are too.  That’s great news that the session went well, I’m really pleased to hear that!  With regards to your practicums, you don’t need to do any paperwork at all, so long as you have done the debriefs Karim will just talk to you about how those went, he won’t be looking for any paperwork to be submitted.  You used to have to submit paperwork, but Karim took that out earlier this year and I had told you both back then, but you will probably still have the old paperwork which still talks about it – so you can ignore that!  So if that is ok for you – that you don’t need to do any prep work for it – are you still ok to meet or would you like to rearrange?",High-B
"If it was really bad yes I would stay at home, I did one day last week, but it’s nice to get out of the house while I still can, so I’ve just been doing a slow walk into the office!    I hope you manage to find two strong men to help with the boxes!",High-B
"I haven’t heard back from Michelle yet, so I’m not sure if she will be available for the 12:15 slot.  I’d give her a shot on GTM and if that fails perhaps try her mobile which she told me was: 01258 4zr 333 (from a Blackberry) – so I’m deciphering that to be 01258 497 333.  If she isn’t there please just let me know and I’ll chase up for another time.",High-B
"Please find the quarterly sales report attached, with the second tab for Q2 now added.  If you have any questions or queries at all please don’t hesitate to contact me.",High-B
"The 1st July would be best if possible as Karim is taking an HBDI session on the 4th.  On the 1st he is currently free anytime except between 2-3pm when he has another call.  Would you like to confirm which time works best for you?  Also I don’t have a telephone number for you on file, could you share that with me, or are you happy for me to set up a Go To Meeting via your computer with Karim?  Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",High-B
"Thanks for letting me know, I’ve just pushed it back to 12:15 for now while I check with her if that works.",High-B
"I set up the order to be looked after by our fulfilment team earlier this morning, although I know they had a lot of orders to get through so hopefully it shouldn’t be much longer until you receive the soft copies from them by email along with the tracking details as they will be sending that out today to you.    If you have any questions or queries about the reports or the delivery please don’t hesitate to get in touch.",High-B
"Have you got a screen shot of it?  It’s a Pardot form so I guess we would have to take it up with them…  have you tried again since, starting from the beginning?",High-B
"Do you mean you have tried to put an entry through or you can’t even see it?  It takes me to the questions, but I haven’t tried to enter anything myself – although Paul did a test and that worked.",High-B
"Thanks, that does make me feel better! ;-)   Hope you are having a lovely time in Paris!    My brother arrived last night for his stag weekend in London, so had a bit of a late night as we had to pick him up from Stansted at 11:30pm to stay with us and he’ll head to London today.  So tired – need coffee!",High-B
"No, it looks like it was meant to be there! Karim just spotted I spelt Katja's name wrong (with a y), so annoyed with myself as I should know better!",High-B
"I am very well, and I hope you are the same. Thanks for asking!  To confirm, yes you will set up the access code through the HBDI Administration portal (HTMS). If you need any assistance with this please let me know and I will be happy to walk you through.  I will be gladly set up an order from my end for the materials that you need. Please let me know the quantity of package materials that you would like to order (must be in quantities of 10), the shipping address, the date you need the materials by, and preferred method of payment (credit card or invoice).  If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward to your reply.",High-B
11am is all I have for this morning. I sent an updated invite.,High-B
Could you place this order below that Jeff is requesting? This needs to go out today and be shipped 2day for delivery on Tuesday if at all possible.  Let me know if you have any questions and/or concerns.,High-B
Please see the e-mail below from someone at IBM who wishes to take the assessment. Could you please direct her to the IBM Portal.,High-B
"Thank you for updating me on the number of remaining seats for EFH.  I updated the SOW; however, I need actual dates to use in the Agreement for AXON migration. Can we discuss this tomorrow and figure out the best date to use?",High-B
"I went through the e-mail again. I think you covered all of the high-level points perfectly. You gave him enough information to build a case, but not so much information that it will drown him.  I added a couple of trademarks in blue, but those are the only edits that I have. Let me know if you need anything else.  P.S. I really love this idea if I haven’t told you so already ;)",High-B
"Sorry for the delayed response. Since this is out of the box, I had to ideate with Leslie.  We can do this and we will sell the perf. sheets to UCB as an individual item.  The cost if they order blank perf sheets to print themselves would be $2.00 per sheet.  If they want us to print the information, the cost will be $12.00 per sheet and it will follow the normal 24 hour timeline for processing as standard HBDI’s®.   Let me know if you have any additional questions.",High-B
Can someone help with the request below?,High-B
Can someone look into the e-mail below?,High-B
Can you answer Brenda’s question?,High-B
"Cynthia Radford (SC) would be the closest facilitator that we have; however, she is a master facilitator and her rate that she charges us would be $2500.  Let me know if you want me to ask if she is available.  My next suggestions would be Curtis Curry (FL) - $1500 and Yvonne Gaines (NY) - $1200. UCB would be responsible for their travel & expenses.",High-B
"I have provided the amount spent from Fossil in 2015/2016 below:  2015 Total: $26,483.75   2016 YTD Total: $23,104.82   You will find full details of the purchases in the excel sheets attached. Let me know if you have any questions. :)",High-B
Please approve the attached expense report for Jeff.,High-B
Do you have a specific contact name vs. just SAP?,High-B
"Please send me your revised WEB Reports from my request earlier this morning ASAP.  Dominic is awaiting the revised report and I need to get this to him before tomorrow morning.   If you have any questions, or need assistance please let me know.",High-B
"At your earliest convenience, could you reach out to Eric and assist him with moving forward with the TA.",High-B
"The customer & speaking engagement reference on this order is incorrect. This was pointed out yesterday and not corrected before approved.   Finance,   Please correct the alignment before billing.",High-B
"I hope this e-mail finds you well.  Since Leigh declined our offer for the CRM Position on the West Coast, Dominic would like to start interviewing a new set of potential candidates to cover the vacant territory.  Could you please start pulling resumes again? As you come across qualified candidates please send the resume’s directly to me. I will work on having them complete the HBDI® and schedule an initial phone interview with Dominic.  If you have any questions please let me know.",High-B
"It is so nice to hear from you. It has been a while. I have recently transitioned into a new role at HI; however, I have copied your new point of contact Bethany Fields.   Bethany is the Account Manager for UCB and she can help with the request below and any future orders/logistics that you need.",High-B
Thanks Karim for the information below.  Could you and Yosuke confirm what time zone you will be located in next week and make sure your calendars are up to date. I will coordinate a time that works for all 3 of us to select our focused fundamental.,High-B
Can you set-up and send access for Jeff to enter the CP Site?,High-B
This is a great start on the Fossil proposal. I have attached my edits and DC may want to make a few last minute changes.  I basically went in and made sure all of the font in the correct format and changed the sizes of some of the pictures to make it fit and flow better. Let me know if you have any questions.,High-B
Thanks. I sent an invite for tomorrow at 3pm CT. for Dominic to call you.,High-B
Dominic is out of the office until tomorrow. I will take a look at his calendar to see what he has available and will send over an invitation.  Can you tell me what the agenda will be for this call?,High-B
We can review tomorrow. I haven’t had a chance to review either one so I don’t have a good read on what he wants yet. One is in a word document and the other is in an e-mail over bullet points.,High-B
I hope this e-mail finds you well. Dominic asked me to connect with you to work on the Job Description and Offer Letter for our upcoming new hire – Anne Griswold.  He also has a question about her address as well. Could you please let me know a date/time that we could connect? Dominic would like to see both documents completed by Wednesday 2/17th when I have my call with him at 2:30pm EST.,High-B
Agenda – MSS Call 1.21.2016  Axon Training Requirements (Dominic) Marketing Update (Yosuke) Recap/Feedback from Grow Big Call with Mo Bunnell (Dominic) Team Updates (MSS Team),High-B
I have a few to add from this week but mostly Q2 opportunities. Traveling to FL next week so should be adding to pipeline.,High-B
"I’m right there with you. All the more reason why sharing what is and isn’t working in the sales process is critical to our success and growth.   I don’t know about you, but I like to WIN and WIN BIG, why I came to Herrmann and for me (and my big GREEN brain) it’s about streamlining or even creating processes where there aren’t any so we can scale, automate and get stuff going FAST – build up a transactional base and then always have a handful of BIG accounts/deals in the pipeline.",High-B
Already did that. But she wanted examples of the Templates that are missing. And I told her pretty much all of them.  Can you do me a favor and send me a screen capture from your HS when you are in a contact record and going to send an e-mail and go to the template drop down menu to choose which e-mail to send.  If it isn’t too much trouble!,High-B
Awesome!!!! Seeing first-hand the impact of HBDI and Whole Brain Thinking with this group was hugely impactful for me.   Thank you Karim for reaching out to this group and letting us be a part of the learning.,High-B
I have a personal iPad Mini that I can bring if we want to show some of the content on a different form factor? Just a thought.,High-B
Calling her on her cell so I’ll call you first and then conference her in.,High-B
Good Morning! The only customer that I have on Axon is Kilpatrick and Stockton and I’d be happy to check with them to see if they would be interested in Beta testing the new Digital Profile Pack.,High-B
Hello Jeff! Sorry I had to throw you into voice mail :( I have a call in 10 minutes with Ashely that shouldn’t take too long (to wrap up a proposal) and then I can call you..so around 11:45ish EST.,High-B
"Okay. I was just e-mailing you. I'm on there but have a message that says: ""waiting for the presenter.""",High-B
Here you go! I'm at an early lunch meeting with Cox right now bout call me after 1 EST if you have questions.,High-B
Hi Jeff. I just called you back but got your voice mail. I was another call and couldn’t click over fast enough. Just call me back when you are free.,High-B
I concur. Just let us know what we ultimately decide.,High-B
"I have a ShoutOut for Toni :) While Bethany was out on medical leave, she was a huge help in getting things done internally and even getting on the phone with me and a few customers!  My next one would be for the AM and CRM team collectively, including Ashley and having some really productive and insightful calls over the last few months on all things sales..what’s working, what’s not working in our sales efforts for prospecting and lead generation; best practices from other customers that we’ve been able to share; positioning our various products and services within an organization….the list is long!  Hope you are having a good trip. Travel safely back to the UK :)",High-B
"I second that!! It is exhausting, and not a good of time for me to have to make request to my AM to look up this kind of information and then wait for a response. If we can move some of the NetSuite data into HubSpot for “view only” then I’d like to understand what the hold up is?",High-B
"If you find it, can you please share with all? Most of my e-mails on DPP have been “one-offs” after I’ve had a conversation with a customer so mine are pretty specific.",High-B
"Do you want to join me at 2 pm EST for a call with Hearst Autos? Miranda is attending certification in October here in Atlanta and came from Cox Automotive (one of our biggest customers: Autotrader, Manheim etc. to name a few of the companies under the Cox umbrella).",High-B
"Please go ahead and follow up on this one as the e-mail address is cox.net which tells me this is an individual that is simply an “end-user” of Cox Media’s internet services and not a Cox Automotive employee, which would be CoxAuto.com or one of their other companies like DealerTrack, Manheim or AutoTrader.   If it turns out they are affiliated with Cox, then please let me know.  Happy Selling!",High-B
"Just a head’s up on this and my 2 cents…..Connect at some point (sooner rather than later), with resellers in your territory as many of them specialize in HBDI combined with sales training i.e. Mo Bunnell and BIG for example, and they may have contacts/relationships with prospect companies that you are contacting.     I had this come up just this week with a reseller in Atlanta, who works specifically with the sales and marketing group at Home Depot so now, she and I are going to leverage that relationship and I’ll bring her into the account with L&D and Operations/Strategy divisions, which is where we play, so we can work together and combine efforts to expand HBDI across the entire organization.",High-B
"LOL! You were busy schmoozing and building relationships….all the RED stuff that you love ;-)   On the E-mail Hunter – there is a plug in for LinkedIn. Download it! When you are in Sales Navigator, you’ll now see a “hunter” tab. (attached is a picture). When you click on it, a logical company e-mail address will come up (second picture) with a confidence score. WAY COOL!! Off and running now on prospecting and messaging.",High-B
Looks like Zech has it on our calendars for next Thursday!,High-B
My vote is for RSM...differentiates our role from AM with little or no explanation needed.,High-B
"Not opposed however just a head’s up that flying in and out of Omaha is not easy…hardly any direct flights so folks usually get routed through Chicago, St. Louis or Denver and the airfare can be pricey so that may be a deterrent.",High-B
Rest up!! We all miss you.,High-B
"Speaking from my experience thus far, get with them quickly. I’ve already wasted too much time on what I thought were “warm” prospects based on web-site traffic and other indicators, only to find out that they are accounts “owned” by a reseller. HubSpot is great for a lot of metrics related to website phising etc. but I’ve discovered that the “leads” that will pop up, are 9 out of 10 times, tied to a reseller – and HubSpot does not give us that level of visibility – only NetSuite or Donna do. Bring on NEW LOGOS!!",High-B
"Thanks Quinton! One day….trade-shows or at least the exhibition part of it will probably go away. I know in companies that I’ve previously worked for and even done some consulting with, that it is always the largest line item in their annual budgets with the least ROI (I’m sure Betsy would agree).",High-B
Thanks! Looking forward to a prosperous 2017!!!,High-B
"Thanks. I’m local  - well, 30 miles north of downtown ATL! If you stay at any of the recommended hotels, everything is within walking distance of BIG, including restaurants etc. Let’s touch base on this towards the end of this week. I’ll be completely out-of-pocket the week of October 10th.  Your account manager (not sure, who you have?) should train you on Axon so you can pull your profiles and also set up “no charge” HBDIs. Unless I’m running around out of the office in meetings, this makes it easier for me but our AM team is there to help.",High-B
Ugh.. I hear you on making the contacts stick to an account record. I’m having issues there too. Not having problems with  my notes though. Maybe we are trying to get HS to do too much for us sales folks?!?! Just saying!,High-B
Ann just emailed me and needs to speak to me at 2:30 regarding some issues we are having with UCB over in Europe. Can we push our call to 3:00? I'm sorry for the last minute urgent request but Ann has to call over to Europe after our call.,High-B
"Fascinating test of recognition of emotions—related to empathy. The included Linked story on reading fiction for building those skills is also fascinating! Try the test—see what score you get. I suggest going with your first instinct. Mine was always right. When I doubted it and tried to analyze, I chose another and it was wrong. Data also shows that the analytical processes neutralize our empathy systems ..a great example!",High-D
Great! Let me know…,High-D
Saturday am sounds great-and love to see the family as well!   Where and when works best for you? Ireland is amazing.. So beautiful ..,High-D
Looks like Monday is out—have to be in Paris. So it looks like Friday is the only option for a meeting/lunch with Victoria—or Saturday with you Sue but do not expect a weekend meeting unless you see the value : )  Let me know!,High-D
"Betsy- Attached are my notes.   I like him as an artist and I like his work. He seems to have great skills and passion and interest. Great!  I know you are anxious to hire right away- AND I think we need to follow a process in our hires.   With years of experience, I believe strongly in the adage, hire slow, fire fast, so please understand that context and bear with me on making sure you follow a process that allows us to ensure fit and a great hire.  You do not want to find yourself  having waited all this time for a hire and having it not work out.   Domain skills are not usually what get in the way of effectiveness. I was looking for how well he would be working, collaborating, culture fit etc. as you and I had discussed.",High-D
"Portal 1 We want to require the e mail  so we can track who is accessing the TA. The way we are set up pre axon, we cannot give people an individual access code just for THEM,. This way we can monitor who is accessing the TA (in case they pass it around their company) and can intervene.   Portal 2 I think we WANT to require e mail addresses for any download of decks, even abbreviated.  Does that clarify it?  Thanks so much for this under such a short time frame. I learned of this handout complexity this morning while talking to the sponsor.  We can learn from this for the next event. More and more speaking events will be of this type and have this type of situation- Linda now knows to get you involved early on for anything marketing related.  Thank you!!!!",High-D
Assume you get these..?,High-D
We asked him to make changes and he did not. We did send him a request! Wonder if it got lost!  We heard from him July 3rd with a  draft and with IP dept. transition had not replied yet. We will let him know immediately as we had requested these changes. We can hold off putting it on the website until the changes are made if we prefer and can let him know that.,High-D
Bev is asking when I will be at the booth—can you copy her too?,High-D
BTW—promise to share what I learn  :),High-D
From our accounting firm- beware!,High-D
Sorry so many typos!! I meant see if you can commit to the development of a bonus plan by April 1st in the offer letter-does that seem legit Shanna? If needed we could say variable bonus of up to 10k to be spelled out in a plan developed by ___ date or something like that?,High-D
Here is what she sent. Pretty close. I told her at the end of the call ( did not warn her ) to recap what she heard.,High-D
"Just a quick question…is there anything that would have changed your mind about the decision you made? I think Betsy thinks she could have “resolved” it if only she had talked with you, based on her conversation with you Friday. I am just curious.",High-D
Not sure if the content is useful—most comprehensive list we have I believe.,High-D
Nice note from Lei…,High-D
Rough draft…probably some gaps and overlaps…hope this helps. Not sure of %’s – events may be 15 and research 25…let me know how it goes!,High-D
"I wrote you ( see below) asking if you could show me how to set this up in Axon ( I know last week was crazy). I now need to get this done tomorrow. Can you help me make that happen? Note- I will want to have them use the team dashboard as well, - they will complete it right before my debrief after my session on Jan 21. If best, we can send them both at the same time. I would like to insist everyone do a NEW HBDI for this session so they are all in AXON. They will also need to be able to download and access the app will do another session Jan 22.  If anyone has not been debriefed before I will handle it vs using the TA.",High-D
Oh my-does that mean she now has to double up her payments to pay them back? UHG! Did that happen to anyone else?,High-D
"I hope you had a fantastic Thanksgiving and are recovering from all that great food!  I wanted to update you on some issues we have had , since the very beginning, with Digital Benefits. I am told that you recommended them and asked that we work only with them, so I thought you might want to know about this change. This year has been a nightmare  with them. In spite of the issues we had ( screwed up enrollment for many employees, cancellation scare notice sent out to all mid year, missing employee cards, late enrollements for new employees and on and on) we asked Digital for renewal info for 2016 earlier this fall. We did not hear back from them and had to constantly chase them for info- and did nto get anything in time to do the renewal. We had to cancel our planned employee enrollment information meetings since they would not move faster—they always complained it was the insurance co’s problem (they had recommended that company!)",High-D
"FYI— During my 121 with Jennifer, a good question, came up. We wondered if there was a budget for unpaid speaking engagements? Betsy let us know below that there is not (aside from ATD and training I suppose)- but perhaps she is not taking into account the handouts and my travel- not sure. It appears that there is not a budget for the unpaid speaking engagements I am doing? That could be a problem as the expenses I incur, if not reimbursed, would come out of nowhere and not line up with the budget. Maybe we need a thought leadership budget that Jen and I manage?",High-D
Looking forward to the summit. Can you please remind me of the specific format David uses in his breakout sessions like the one I am doing on technology? We discussed the topic but I overlooked asking him about the format. I seem to recall from previous summits that the format is often that each panelist speaks for a short amount of time (if so how long?) o and then there is group discussion. (I also seem to recall a Q&A format in some sessions) or does it work differently than wither of those? If so what is the format? I also seem to recall that I can use visuals if needed. Please advise as I am working this week to finalize everything.,High-D
Go ahead and book. Sorry if that was not clear.,High-D
"Good—I was hoping you would be ok with it. Since I have worked with her for so long, I wanted her to hear the context from me so you two could focus on the future : )",High-D
Great ! Thanks for letting me know. I spoke with Marla last night and let her know- so you could be speaking opening together. She feels this will accelerate the writing and decision making process. She said she struggles with the re writes with Mark—needing so much detail at the outline phase that she ending up writing it then. I will try and make sure we avoid that—it is not happening with the book so she and I may have a faster sign off process. I was unaware that was happening behind the scenes with Mark.  She seems in a good place! You have managed that relationship well!,High-D
Great news! Wonderful application and terrific revenue per thinker.,High-D
Here it is-I may have changed a few minor things.,High-D
"I caught something in the draft that is a detail but one I think our CP’s might wonder about. See the modification below. It looked like we were putting “leaders” as primarily A quad thinkers because of the phrasing, and there is a weird punctuation after the word better in the following paragraph ( in the original ( attached):  Diversity and inclusion are at the heart of our entire business. It¹s what Whole Brain® Thinking is all about. Being able to tap into the full range of different perspectives, ideas and backgrounds is what makes us better, more effective leaders. As we all focus on our goals, implement, collaborate and innovate, we depend on the synergy that diversity brings us as a team and as partners working with diverse clients, organizations and thinkers around the world.",High-D
See attached for my proposal—once I get the art I can have Nehdi mock this to scale—do we have those exact dimensions? Will need it to finish.  Please comment if you prefer with ABCD or not. Kevin the creativity model in BOT was WAY too much info so I simplified the PS walkaround. Does it work?,High-D
See attached recent trend report. I am looking at it in preparation for my TedTalk style presentation at LEAD later this month on the future of work and agility. If you see anything else out there that would be of interest please pass that on!,High-D
"Note—many did not actually attend. I suggest you also send the attendance report that Yosuke can pull to show who attended, asked which question , answered polls etc.",High-D
Glad this all worked out :)   Jennifer is a great resource!!!,High-D
Thanks Betsy—actually I will be up at my Mom’s tomorrow waiting on a delivery and most likely can work around your schedule. Why don’t you send me some options and I will see what seems to work best?,High-D
"Thanks Betsy.  The list sounds complete. My questions:  *         Will everything, including the handout, be in color (except the other side of the card stock)?  *         Will the postcards be similar to the last ones we created? If you can send me the art it will help in my presentation as I refer to them *         Can you please send the attachments?: ) *         I trust they know their attendance so we should be able to produce very close to what we need with very little waste.  *         I trust the comment about ‘we cannot give them everything ‘ and pen/note paper means you will leave the communication model as is?  Thanks!",High-D
"Wow-Well done! Congrats are in order. I am sure you must be very excited.  In reading through it, I noted a typo in our company description on page 4:  …Many businesses are trying to more with less, (while) with the need to close the gap in knowledge and skills.   Also on page 14: Ann Herrmann-Nehdi   It may be too late to fix—but if you will be distributing PDF’s and can change those I would appreciate it! Thanks and see you at ICE.",High-D
Thanks for the catch Danny! See corrected version attached.,High-D
They have now taken this into hand and have reached out : )  BTW my car is telling me that the brake pads are worn out- I have a call into BMW service in A ville for a potential appt Thursday am- based on calendar that seemed to be the easiest. Will let you know when I hear back.,High-D
Unless you think I need to look at them- I trust your eyes are enough! Thanks for keeping this moving!,High-D
Hmmm. This is bizarre—suggest a phone call perhaps with them to clarify where the ai files are? If they needed to change them and them move to jpeg for some reason we need to understand why and how to fix these!,High-D
Figure 3-7 needs to have the “3” moved to the correct quadrant (B). Nehdi is working on it right now.  Per you great suggestion- I edited the FM to acknowledge Pat’s work on the proofing ( attached).  Otherwise all is fine with these.,High-D
"I think the point about customisation is an important one. They are currently working on their on boarding process – one idea is to use this certification as a working session where the activities contribute to the creation of a Whole Brain onboarding approach (and hopefully, by extension, the HBDI becomes an integral part). If possible I would like to be involved in any discussion with the client that pertains to the customisation…",High-D
I think we're fine to proceed – glad we’ve finally gotten something arranged. Thanks for your efforts to get this put together!,High-D
"All they could tell me is that they were trying for late March, but that they didn’t think it was going to be feasible as they are apparently getting together in late February and it would be difficult to get everyone together again so soon. Why they didn’t just use the time in February, I don’t know…  They asked me to put together some info about how our tools are used in on-boarding situations, so I’m going to prepare that and hopefully get an audience with Nina in the next few weeks to discuss. I’ll try to use that opportunity to nail down the cert as well…  Thanks!",High-D
"Thanks for making some time for us to meet today!  I am available 1pm, and Orin is trying to rearrange his diary so that he might join as well. Shall we plan to meet you at the Hammersmith offices?",High-D
"Hi, yes we would be very happy to meet up with Novie on Friday! Alternatively we could do it first thing (maybe 830am or latest 9am) tomorrow or Thursday, as the exhibition doesn’t start until 10am and is very close to Coke’s Hammersmith offices (assuming that is where they are based?).",High-D
"In preparation for the meeting, we’d once again like to have everyone meet for small group discussions. This time around, we’d like to ask everyone to select one of the Fundamentals that you are going to commit to focusing on between now and the next HAT meeting. In your groups, we’d like for you to discuss some of the steps you’ll be taking to develop on this Fundamental, getting feedback and input from your group mates. As an output of the discussion, we’d like for each group to submit one slide outlining which Fundamental each of you will be focusing on, with some explanation of why and how you’ll do so.   To make things interesting, the Fundamental you choose will be your entry into a lotto-style drawing for a $250 Amazon gift card. One Fundamental will be chosen at random, and the prize will be split among everyone who chose that particular Fundamental as a focus – so choose wisely!",High-D
"In addition to reviewing the Fundamentals, our agenda will be to cover:  * New team member introductions * Shout-outs and team mate of the quarter  As per usual, departmental WIG updates will be sent as pre-reading in advance of the meeting, and we can also spend any time needed addressing questions.",High-D
"So, I’d like to ask that in the next few days you quickly install the latest build of the app on your own Apple or Android device(s) and give it a test run. I know that there have been client questions about some of these bugs, so we want to get this done as quickly as possible! Assuming that this final batch of testing goes well, we hope to submit the latest version to the app stores early next week.",High-D
"Please join me in welcoming Naomi Morton to the Herrmann team!  Naomi is joining the Global Innovation team as Product Development Manager, based in London – her first day was actually last Monday, but she was in Cert all week so I figured I would wait until today to introduce her. Attached is her HBDI® profile, for everyone’s reference (don’t worry, she authorised my sending it along!)  Below is a quick intro that Naomi prepared, along with a photo – please take a moment to introduce yourself to her (ideally via Slack :) when you have a chance. We’re very excited to have her on board!",High-D
"Now, we'd like for you to come back to these commitments to evaluate your progress. If you haven't already, meet with your group mates, and share what you've done over the past few months to focus on your Fundamental. What has worked? What hasn't? Be honest with yourself and your group mates, and ask for feedback on how you're doing.  For the meeting, we'd like for each team to come prepared with what insights and lessons they've taken away from their combined efforts to adopt the values and behaviors we subscribe to at Herrmann. Whether from your own experiences or those of your peers, we're hoping that we can all learn from one another as we endeavor to build a great company and great careers. So, please come prepared to share in whatever format you think best represents your group. Be creative! We can't wait to see what you've done.",High-D
"Oh well, I did it all. The online signatures are tough!",High-D
"Happy to do this but is it really relevant for me? I’m not a US employee and Ann doesn’t track my PTO so if it costs us more for me to have a seat, I’d just as soon be rid of it.",High-D
Ha I just got an email and started worrying it was spam – thanks for notifying!,High-D
"We are starting peer review now, so it probably won’t make its way into an academic journal for a while. But that doesn’t stop us from creating an executive summary type of document that can be used for sales & marketing purposes",High-D
"I’ll see what I can pull together.  In the meantime, the Cognitive Diversity metrics we've used in the INSEAD research (latest version attached) can and should make their way into our DoT toolkit. I’ll leave it to your marketing mastery to come up with great branded names for them…",High-D
"I need to head to bed as I have an early pitch to Balfour Beatty tomorrow morning. Christina, can you please give Dominic an update on the TA mockups?",High-D
"Some edits in line below. I think we hold off on showing examples until we share the feedback? Otherwise I would want to put together a more comprehensive overview of the new branding elements, drawing from the materials that 3c provided as outputs from the last phase.  Thanks!",High-D
Just a reminder that each team will need to send their updated recommendations to Jennifer by this Wednesday! Your input will be important for the LT as we make progress on our plans for 2016. Please make sure you’ve had a chance to get back together as a team to reflect on the HAT meeting discussions and finalize your recommended actions.  Please also complete the survey if you haven’t already!,High-D
Wait I’m confused – didn’t your last email say you weren’t available to meet today? Just let me know as I was planning to reschedule some meetings this afternoon so we could get a few hours together…,High-D
"I think it would be better if you could join Dominic – there’s no urgency around this date, so we can reschedule to next week",High-D
"Just to clarify, there was not an expectation that your groups would create slides for the HAT meeting activities – if you have, you can send them over to me for inclusion in the presentation, but if you haven’t please just plan to speak up on the call tomorrow!",High-D
"Just a quick reminder to please submit your votes for the 2016 rallying cry by end of day…  Thanks, and have a great weekend!",High-D
"As you probably saw, I’ve responded to him. If you aren’t available to meet in person today then let’s plan to get together in person next week as I’m driving up to NY tomorrow and will most likely need to stay until Monday to deliver a session for a UK client up there.",High-D
We all agree with you. Unfortunately due to a communication error an early working draft of a design concept was used. This will not be the Brain Bytes header moving forward.  We’ll certainly be in touch as / when appropriate.,High-D
"To provide a bit more context on the date change for the upcoming HAT meeting: a number of team members were not available on the original date, so we’ve decided to reschedule in hopes of getting maximum participation across the company. During the meeting, the Leadership Team will be sharing the outcomes of our recent strategy meetings, as well as the actions we will be taking as a company in response to the development recommendations that were shared in the November HAT meeting.  We’ll be providing a more detailed agenda, as well as the departmental pre-readings, next week.",High-D
"Just as a reminder, for today’s session please come prepared to present the standard agenda outputs (the three points below) as well as your reflections on 2015 – what went well, and how we can improve in 2016.  Thanks and looking forward to our discussion!",High-D
Received. I will review and let you know if I have questions,High-D
Can we meet today instead of tomorrow? Am free for the rest of the afternoon.,High-D
"Further to our discussion today, you should now have alternating meetings on your calendars for Thursdays, replacing our current team WIG meetings – a 2 hour Sprint review meeting aligned to the current Axon sprint schedule, the first of which will be next Thursday 17 Dec, and a shorter stand-up meeting on the off week, the first of which will be 7 Jan.  Sorry about the multiple invitations I sent around – should all be done now, but please let me know if you have any questions about this.  Also I neglected to mention on today’s call that I will be Out of Office Thursday and Friday of this week, and Monday of next week, so please reschedule any of our recurring meetings we have booked for those days if they are needed.",High-D
"I agree that this doesn’t give the most professional feel. I don’t mind the thought bubbles (although the thumbs up is hard to decipher, and the piggy bank could be tightened up a bit) but the hand-drawn graphics on page 2, 3 and 8 don’t fit and look unrefined. Christina, I assume that this is still in mockup stages? For final version we can move a bit closer to the vector+ink hybrids we have been discussing for the TA… Betsy an example attached for your reference, or otherwise: http://keepearthquakesweird.com/grid",High-D
1130 your time / 430 mine?,High-D
Um I’m pretty sure I just changed it? Please check and confirm,High-D
"TO BE CLEAR – Bowman doesn’t work for Herrmann any more, and has proven himself flaky. Let’s not rely on him.",High-D
Fixed,High-D
Just a reminder that each team will need to send their updated recommendations to Jennifer by this Wednesday! Your input will be important for the LT as we make progress on our plans for 2016. Please make sure you’ve had a chance to get back together as a team to reflect on the HAT meeting discussions and finalize your recommended actions.  Please also complete the survey if you haven’t already!,High-D
"I’ve also just checked the form online, and there shouldn’t be an issue on that side of things. I would suggest that we check the situation with the service email account before re-doing all of the forms on the WIX site.",High-D
"End of Q1 at the earliest, and no – I don’t think there are are e-debriefed per se – just that that they have abridged reports that they sell.",High-D
Virlina and I have the survey results and will be sharing them soon. We’re just working to assess the estimated workload for each so that we can prioritise according to both impact and feasibility.,High-D
"Just to be clear - will we switch presenters (i.e., the slides will be piped through my computer) or will I just be clicking through your slides? If the latter, how will we add in the slide with the analysis of Richard’s opening remarks?",High-D
"Attached are the updated product slides.  A few notes:  I’ve added in Christina’s new mockups where possible. These is still one phone in the mockups because I can’t remove it, but hopefully that’s not a big deal.  I rearranged the slides a little bit for better flow and added animations etc. throughout.  I added in the analysis of a sample agent script. Obviously the first slide, which will be used for the analysis of Richard’s presentation, will be updated live during the presentation.",High-D
I’m not giving you sh*t :). Let me check my archives – because Linkedin has been working for me like crazy. The recent HR.COM webinar leads have been very fruitful developing starter conversations there.,High-D
"Shanna, can you help me?  Thank you Dorothy.",High-D
Happy Birthday Ann Herrman-Nehdi!,High-D
"Thank you for sharing Brenda & Sarah, I already am cultivating a few “test Linkedin” notes utilizing the template you shared.  I will update the team on the response rate on our next call.",High-D
This lead (Helen Little) is located in New Zealand – should I contact this or should it be assigned to someone else.,High-D
I will find out and inform you. Thank you Quinton & Yosuke.,High-D
No problem I just sent her a Go-To meeting invite directly instead.,High-D
"Not I, says the cat :)!  If you get something from the other team members, please share?",High-D
Lets talk about it on Monday,High-D
I will call in for the call! I cannot let Yosuke or the team down.,High-D
"Just as an alert Yosuke – I was working off the Diversity of Thought webinar leads….  I have the company SCA, but they also have a large international prescense and this contact is in Germany.  Who should that be assigned too?",High-D
Good Stuff!,High-D
"Yo!  How are you doing?  I spoke with Dominic, and he mentioned we should schedule a call to discuss your email below…does that sound correct?",High-D
"Christiana, Anne captured everything I had on my list – I doubled checked.",High-D
Just leaving the gym and will shoot it over too you soon,High-D
"Jennifer,  I cannot meet tomorrow – I am traveling away from home office and will be on the plane at that time",High-D
"No problem, have a wonderful day!",High-D
I’m not sure I recall. Call me if you like.,High-D
"This is big Quinton, thanks for the slides!",High-D
"Brenda,  here is a piece of information I gathered for you today from the Kilpatrick Townsend Linkedin page.  Maybe a great way or theme to lead a conversation with?",High-D
"Yes, sending the next email out at the end of next week will be perfect.  I’ll be happy to draft the email — can you send me your generic email, please?  Thanks!",High-D
"Quinton, I am so sorry to hear that you tangled with a 25 lb. weight and came out on the losing end!  Hope your comfort level increases quickly!",High-D
Interesting … I got a confirmation from Betsy with all the info … and it WILL NOT load to my Outlook Calendar.  Hmmmmm….  cyber monkies?,High-D
"Because I'm a selfish human being I was only thinking about MY needs … if we can do this for the Reseller Agreements then we should go so far as to load the MSA for the Directs, too!",High-D
Thanks for this explanation.  I found the field in Hubspot under ‘All Properties’ for the status and it is populated under that view.  I didn’t realize that I need to go through Add Properties to have it displayed on the Contact’s main page.  Will take care of that little issue.,High-D
"Welcome aboard, Anne!  Looking forward to working with you!",High-D
"I'll contact him today to make sure he's all set.  No doubt it's something on his end, but not something we need to spend a lot of time troubleshooting.",High-D
"Will you please check to see if Tom Boldrey is registered for the Reseller Conference Call?  He had trouble with the survey and then the link to Register did not work.  After many attempts, his survey did finally submit and I received it.  If he is not registered, will you please send him the link?",High-D
I think it’s a great idea.,High-D
"Great – so, what about one for Aimee Gibson from yesterday … can you retrieve it, possibly?",High-D
He should’ve received an automated email with instructions on how to get back to the survey.  Ask him to check his Junk Mail.  I’ve copied Kim Zappel in case she has further information.  Thanks for the update on the Reseller Agreement — I look forward to receiving it.,High-D
"See Jim's email below.  Does the pre work not include the day schedule - start and stop times?  And, WHERE? Please let them know what to expect.",High-D
"JEANNE — your pricing going forward will be:  SELF-PROCESSING:  $  32 per HBDI Profile, access & profile package materials  (order a minimum of 10) $  175 per HBDI Team Profile $  32 per HBDI Pair Profile",High-D
"Email the list of names to us, please!",High-D
"If they do this in the HTMS, I believe all these languages are available for printing the data pages — the 4 quadrant booklet would be in ENGLISH.  This can be confirmed with Dorothy — or the flags can be checked.  Then — it would be absolutely necessary for Symmetrics to let us know the breakdown of names/language.",High-D
"No, the HTMS will not be shut down on June 30 — don’t worry, we will not forget about you.  FYI — the HTMS now has a notice that it will be July 31.  Thanks for reaching out and I hope that I’ve made you feel more comfortable!",High-D
"I talked to Dorothy about Anthony’s database last week and she told me that the database can be built to include all the layers (clients) and then migrate each client separately as they currently have separate databases in the HTMS.  My assumption is that the Development Team will build the AXON database, yes?",High-D
Excellent — THANKS!,High-D
Not sure we know that.  Might be best to set it for 15 accesses.,High-D
"We’ll take care of setting up this Order today!    BTW - no doubt you’ve seen several emails in the last few months regarding our moving over to a new database platform, and new software — AXON — you and I need to connect soon to discuss what this means to you and your consulting practice.  Let me know a few days/times that you’re available for a 15-20 minute call to go over the new Reseller Agreement that is the first step and go over what you can expect in the next few weeks.",High-D
So good to hear from you. Concert on crutches! Go you! Tomorrow is fine. I’ve got 12 – 1 and 2-3 open – or we could chat after 4:30.,High-D
CONGRATULATIONS MARIA! This is fantastic news.,High-D
Err then I would leave it for now – Got a lot on my plate -  if I come up with something and just happen to send it your way and you can  do what you will with it otherwise…. didn’t happen lol.,High-D
Evening all. Thursday I will be awol from 1 – 4. Design crunch – Friday/ Monday I am fair game – Who will set up the goto meeting?,High-D
"This email is to inform you of my resignation from my position as Lead Designer.   It has been a pleasure working with the team over the last year and a half, however I have decided to accept another opportunity.  This has been a difficult decision as I am truly passionate about Whole Brain Thinking, our team, our brand and our products and felt I have added value to the mission at Herrmann.   I do feel that the current lack of red and green at Herrmann needs to continue to be improved and while there have been recent steps taken to address some components in these areas, I feel this is the best decision.   I know Herrmann is on it’s way to launching some amazing new products and rebrand - I am honored to have been apart of such an innovative team and look forward to following your continued success. As I stated before I think WBT can truly impact the world.  Thank you again for the opportunity to work for Herrmann International. I wish you and your staff all the best.",High-D
No I have not shared with them yet. I have taken notes on what needs to be wrapped up or handed off and I planned on touching base with them today and tomorrow. I can discuss this with you this Thursday if you are available.   Let me know.,High-D
"This is good, will review. I was going to head to usual spot at 9:00am?",High-D
"Sure we can meet in person. Do you have any place in mind? I believe in what is being done at Herrmann and have been keen on expressing that Herrmann is doing great things for the world especially to Naomi.  Everyone has been taking care of Naomi these past few weeks as well. From giving up rooms, taking care of her when she fell ill and letting her know how glad we were to have her on the team.   Let me know what time tomorrow works for you.",High-D
Hey sir able to join the scrip meeting now – at 3?,High-D
Great to hear from you. Have you read over the scripts yet that have been dropped into the google drive folder I linked you to?  Look forward to chatting tomorrow. Talk soon.  Safe travels!,High-D
"Fantastic to here that the edits will be ready next week for review!   I also wanted to take the time to introduce you both to Karim Nehdi, leader of the Innovation Team here at Herrmann, as mentioned before I will no longer be with Herrmann.   He will be taking over the project from here so expect any edits for the final video to be coming from him.  His email is: karim.nehdi@hbdi.com  Look forward to seeing the video update next Tuesday!",High-D
"Steve and Marla are also aware of the transfer – as they were involved in the project and added great value to it. I had been reviewing items with them – Marla correcting copy and Steve also providing animation perspective. We approached it as a team. After consulting with them, I then made final determination on edits.  I made them aware you may be working with them in the final video review and the editing of the remaining 5 scripts if they start being made. (Nothing has been agreed to on the remaining 5– TA+ is under evaluation.) As per my earlier email, I’d like to know what edits you have given them to make – we discussed in Raleigh that I would need to provide final input since there were some content issues, and I believe you said this was our last chance to make edits so I want to make sure this is comprehensive, especially since Natalie isn’t returning until next week?",High-D
I am wrapping everything up today and Saturday if needed. I will be sending you emails today and tomorrow with information on where all files are located and who was involved so if you need to connect with them you can. Does this mean your last day is today/Saturday? As I stated before I will not be available next week. Proper two week notice was given from the 31st of August. I stated my last day was the 21st as I was going to use 3 days next week for PTO ( Still have a balance of 16 unused.) – which previously you indicated I could use in smaller chunks.,High-D
"As I stated in my email this morning, I am planning on sending out an email that clearly outlines where all the files in the Google Drive for those projects are – this includes all the psd/ai files that you or anyone else may need to edit. I will not send that email out till later this evening as I am gathering all my materials and clearly labeling my folders before dropping them onto the drive.  I told Naomi I would be sending out an email with that information at some point  this week. As a secondary way to locate those files quickly I linked them also to the project pages in the DRS. As I normally do, you will see a file structure map to be able to quickly locate those assets in the email.   If there is any additional questions after that email is sent. Let me know.",High-D
Will be changing this to a time that works for both of us – it’s still on my to do list for this week! Look out for a correction soon!,High-D
"My flight was great – slept the entire time so was well rested when we landed. My weekend was wonderful, awesome graphic design and vintage everywhere – I love it.  Tuesday meeting at the collective sounds great- it’s the address you gave me before on Hampstead road correct? Tomorrow I will be banging out the rest of the profile pack 2 and sending you the guess my profile revamp mockup for approval before we ship it off to the dev team – I want to crank those two bits out tomorrow so we maintain our schedule since we made more branding edits last week. For the AU call Tuesday – is there anything you would like me to prepare? How is section 3 video script coming along? Did you see my green jokes in the slack chat?  Hope all is well you in your new flat (Congrats - “almost neighbor) – I am very excited to be here and looking forward to cranking out some great work with you and V:)  See you soon!",High-D
"Thank you so much! Went to a friend’s poetry reading last night – really moved by “The Darkling Thrush – The Century’s End” by Thomas Hardy, was read quite beautifully.  A drink this week sounds lovely, just moved into the space in Notting Hill yesterday – literally 2 minutes walk from Ladbroke Grove. So not sure what is around me yet – would love a tour guide:)  Are we meeting tomorrow at the collective or are you still away?",High-D
Sounds good. Plan on looking this over on the place.   Who has the keys for the Tryon house for tomorrow?,High-D
- I land in Charlotte 10am tomorrow.   - A car rental would be $600- $900 since it would be picked up in Charlotte and dropped off in Raleigh – I just found out purchase cannot go through Creative Travel as they only reserve.  - Originally Steve and I were going to share a car to reduce the amount of rentals for the team but I found out the rental would only come out of one person’s card and that is not something I can do.  - V offered to pick me up on Monday morning from Charlotte – which means I would stay the night in Charlotte until she can come and get me. Steve would also need a ride. I would drive us all back to HQ since V drove to pick us up.   - I am waiting for confirmation from V.,High-D
In prep for the Profile Pack Demo during our company meeting – I have created a page on the Sales Page of the DRS. (Betsy will be using this area to demo the Content Library Product)  I need your help to fill out some of this text. I have excluded demo tutorial video – we can do that after the meeting.  Also want to know where the Demo Profile Pack button should link to – right now it just takes you to the old marvel.  See: http://www.designreviewspace.com/#!sales-team-demo-area/zqqtg  (password: HBDISALES)  In the future I want to include more compelling product shots – bottom page (with people using the item as well) and also feature the product’s Think Square)   Let’s circle up Monday and fill out this page together – let me know your availability.   Thanks!,High-D
"4/3 is fine, although I have to track down the INDD files. Have these already been rebranded once?",High-D
"Also, I never actually have bought any images for Herrmann on iStock or any other site so don't have any of the larger images, Apologies.",High-D
"As for the answers to questions directed to me, yes it is both feasible to have book page 1 up by March 31 if not before. Also I can get you a snippet of the interview by Monday the 30th COB",High-D
"bowmankelley is my skype name. Want to talk tomorrow? I don't usually have skype on because I get random calls (I have used it for ages) so email me a timeslot and I'll leave it on. i.e. 11 - 2 or whatever,",High-D
Can you send me the word document? Also is this too cheesy or going in the right direction?,High-D
"I am assuming that you were refering to me but since you addressed the email to ""Richard"" I cannot be sure. I would like to have a call with you, Nitesh and I on Friday. Please suggest a time and I can see if it will work. Late morning or afternoons Eastern Standard Time work best for me.",High-D
I have login credentials to draw down data from the server if that is what you need:  Username: HRYH6004  Password: e0123  Let me know: You can login as me at interactive.hbdi.com <http://interactive.hbdi.com>  as well.,High-D
"I was told that the TA module was able to communicate to the server and pull in real Profile Data. As this point this project is not useful to us. The whole purpose of the Course is to pull in individual data, please provide me names and original contract so I can see who signed off on this.  When I delivered the Input files to you, there is a mechanism in there to make a call to our servers to pull in real Profile data, I think your team has overlooked this.",High-D
"Yes that is fine and I look forward to talking to you then,",High-D
Come to think of it I can't do the same header and footer as herrmannsolutions.con since that site is NOT responsive. I could make something like it though with all the links and graphics. I am assuming that these attached files are what you want on there?,High-D
"DONE, I have linked up the ZIp file to Press Pack button, can you confirm that it works on a PC please?",High-D
FIXED. I don't know how that got mixed up but thanks for pointing it out.,High-D
"I have installed yhose 3 plug-ins: Yoast SEO, Page Speed and WPTouch but there is ahuge problem with the WPTouch one. When we developed the website it is heavily customized with custom features and templates that most pages do not have anything in the Wordpress content area at all, so WPTouch is incapable of reading them and just pulls up a blank page. Any page with text in the content area does show up but it is effectively worthless.   I deactivated the plug-in but feel free to activate it and see how the site does on the phone. You will see it is unusable. The only option we have, at least at this point, is to hand code for the phone.   You are set up with webmaster tools and I took a look a page speed insights.",High-D
"Yes I have the DVD of that debrief in a stack of DVDs on my desk down in Lake Lure, It is called ""Process Revealed"" and that is written on the surface of it. Feel free to try and find it if you'd like.  I will be down there maybe on Thursday depending on Dorothy's availablility but that may be too late.",High-D
"I will have to get back to you on a timeline for fixing the site and making it mobile-friendly. However we have numerous changes on the development site that would affect the templates. I will need to talk  to Betsy and find out what changes that are on the Agilithink site currently that we are going to implement on the real website,",High-D
My daughter is ill today so I have had to spend the morning with her going various places but wondered whether you could talk this afternoon and say 3 again briefly?,High-D
"Sorry for the delay Yosuke. Please like the Whole Brain Facebook ""Fan Page"" and I can add you as an Admin. I tried but until you like the page, I can't assign you those permissions.",High-D
"No we don't, the file is huge (3.5 GB) but I could rip the DVD and put it on youtube as an unlisted video (youtube would compress it)",High-D
"Great news, thanks for letting me know,",High-D
"Great, I will start in earnest on the site tomorrow.   Hope you had a great time down under and you took some pictures.",High-D
"We just wrapped up a GREAT session at SHRM (that’s the annual conference for HR professionals). Ann presented her session “Diversity of Thought: Where D&I Meet the Bottom Line” to an audience of ~175 people.   Some people gave us their business cards, so the sales team will receive leads from that.   If you get any requests for the materials (if anyone calls or emails), please direct them to the landing page below (“There are a lot of diversity of thought resources, so check it out!”), or go there yourself and put in their name and email address for them to be added to the list.   We’ll get most of our leads via our landing page, where people will sign up to request the session slides, request a demo, and access the following:   -          Diversity of Thought White Paper -          Inclusive Leadership Playbook -          Diversity of Thought webinar replay -          Inclusive Leadership webinar replay -          Diversity of Thought toolkit",High-D
"I don’t believe he has this on his radar at all – I’m not sure if he’s ever done these Biz cards before.  Jen, I looked in the folder that you migrated from DB and I can’t find any of the current business cards in there. Do you know where they mihgt be? Would Christina know?  Once we get Steve set up with the design files and profiles, he can do them.",High-D
"Hey super stars, Joe and I found an easy way to move all of the HERRMANN DESIGN folders and contents from Dropbox into our hbdi.com Google Drive.   We are doing that RIGHT NOW (the upload will take about 30 minutes). I will send out a message when it’s done and I share the new Google Drive Folders with you. After we move it to Google Drive, please DO NOT use the Dropbox folder anymore. If you are working in that folder right now, you may have to re-save your files to Google.   I will be doing the same with EACH Dropbox folder I have access to, and will be sending a similar message to each group affiliated with that folder.   Our goal is to not use Dropbox anymore. It’s not secure, and we need to move everything over to Google.   Let Joe know if you have any questions :)",High-D
"No, have to cancel (sorry!).  I haven’t reviewed the reseller brochure edits yet, but if I find any typos, I’ll send them via Adobe. I got the two model and walk around templates (thank you!!) Just waiting on the other product docs :)",High-D
"Can you send me any images you have of the thinker journey? I’m creating a PPT presentation and I’d love to add that in.  Also, I need some people with profile visuals to illustrate:  My thinking (person with profile over head) me+you (2 ppl interacting with profiles over head) My team (team… with above) My organization (org… with above)  Do you have anything like that?",High-D
"Wow Chris, this is coming together so nicely!! I put some feedback below, in line with your email so I could make sure I get to all of your questions.",High-D
"I don’t think this sits very high in terms of priorities, which is why you might want to let us “take this” and just let us tell you what we need from you. I know Yosuke wants to talk to you about making the forms match your mock ups as much as possible, but that’s a different conversation than what we’re doing, insofar as reengineering the forms and surveys.",High-D
"Go for it Virlina.  One edit: With the info graphic for symptom, problem, solution... the solution is not the products. The solutions are thinking agility, thinking diversity, etc. then how we do it is thru the products.",High-D

"Happy Friday – a few updates for you:  1. Q4 Email Campaign: We sent the email below to previously inactive contacts who opened our promo #4 email from 2 weeks ago. Since different offers may appeal to different folks, we’re testing the approach of letting them choose which offer (because on these contacts, we have minimal data). 2. The Diversity of Thought White Paper is now available: Please feel free to send the link to any HR/D&I prospects as you see fit. It can also be a great tool to use in your messages w/ LinkedIn Sales Navigator to strike up a conversation w/ prospects in your targeted accounts.  We will be doing a broader marketing push with the White Paper in Q1.  3. We are working on a business summary for the Diversity white paper because this current white paper is very HR-heavy.",High-D

It would be a you've heard about it, hopefully downloaded it, now let's talk about how to get the most out of it""""",High-D
"This morning on the leadership team call, we talked about our larger need for a Herrmann file sharing system. Implementation of DatAnywhere has been less than successful so far, and Karim and I are lobbying for a more accessible file sharing system. Dropbox is OK, but we're voting for Box. Dorothy and John will review some options. It may mean that DatAnywhere is the right solution at the end of the day, in which case, this images.herrmann will be a moot point.   That (choosing a file share system) is a parallel work stream to what I've asked though, because I don't want our longer term goals to prevent immediate accessibility.   Does that make sense?",High-D

"I defer to Christina as our Lead Designer to decide who now has permissions to redesign and alter marketing and product material, and what technology platform they use.   In my opinion, Microsoft Word, though widely available, does not support professional design specs. Now that we have Christina, we don't need to democratize the creation of any designed material – marketing or product. MS Word and the other Office products are great for providing mock ups to Christina, but final production should be done using the tools she uses.",High-D
"Great news! Thank you for sharing, Maria!",High-D
"All, I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate you all participating in this important CUSTOMER JOURNEY exercise this week. Especially to Lez, your input and expertise was so valuable, and I wish we could keep you in the States for longer!  I will work on a full write up for the entire company (and Global!) to make them aware of the great work we are doing, and also, I will make sure that this work does not stop. We purposefully ignored certain areas (attraction and sales process, the rest of the CP journey, inspiring our thinkers and CP's to promote and market Herrmann themselves, the HUB experience) so we can give them the full attention they deserve. I have already talked to some Sales team members, including Dominic, and they are VERY excited about this work, and some will be joining us as we dig deeper into the customer journey.   You'll hear from me more after my vacation next week.",High-D
"Bowman, can you please make a quick copy change on the website today?",High-D
"For these thinker submissions, we need to decide on a process so we don't look disorganized in our follow ups to thinker questions. Typically, this would go to Service, but since it's an easy look-up, the first person on this email who can handle it could reply all – got it"" and then CC service on the response?  What do you (all) think?""",High-D
They are all so different; it's hard to give a preference.,High-D
"Thanks Tracy! Can you please load these into Basecamp? We are in the phase of compiling all the website resources mentioned in the book so we can decide which need reformatting, etc.   Marla, Danny will reach out to you about the CEO country data.",High-D
"I have had the time to read the offer letter and other materials you sent and while it looks good in general, I do have a few questions, comments prior to signing.    1. We discussed growth, bonus or incentive"" and I don't see anything in the offer about that.  You mentioned you would follow up with Leslie about this and I am eager to hear what was discussed.  There is a lot of potential business growth I anticipate being a key driver of and support in, and I would like to see some ""reward"" for generating business growth. I would like to have this reflected in my offer letter.",High-D
"2. The benefits not starting until 30 days after my start date are a surprise and this creates a hardship for me. Based on the language of the offer letter, if I started on Monday 2/29, I would be ""covered"" on March 1st. That would be far more appealing than waiting a month. My experience with other companies is benefits are covered as of day one regardless of start date. My proposal is that either start on Monday 2/29, so my benefits start on 3/1 or keep my start date 3/1 and make an exception to start my benefits immediately.",High-D
"3. I am assuming the other points we discussed (email of 2/11 - agreements regarding prior work commitments and development dates) do not need to be in the offer.  They are ""professional"" agreements. That said, let me know if there is anything there that should be in writing.  4. On page 3 of the offer letter, it states I need to complete and sign the ""Herrmann International Application Form"".  Is this form on line or do you have a soft copy? It was not included with the other documents your sent me.    5. Regarding the benefits, I have a few questions - who would be best to speak with?    Thanks in advance for your help with these things.",High-D
"Just an update regarding my email from yesterday.  I have connected with Shanna and she has shared the information needed regarding benefits.  I have also downloaded the employee handbook for some light Saturday reading and filled out the Zenefit info requested.   I know you are busy, and if it helps to connect over the weekend, I am around.  I look forward to hearing from you as you have time.",High-D
Great Idea – I was thinking the same thing.,High-D
Thank you for all you have done Betsy to help make this successful.,High-D
Great Trick!  Thank you for sharing Dorothy!,High-D
"I was telling Betsy about an interesting email I received from a CP based on the marketing email Beckie sent in my name asking CP’s for input.  She shared perhaps I could send it to the goodnews@hbdi.com internal distribution list, so I am sharing!  (I was not aware of this distribution list – but I like the idea :)).  The email is from Rosanne Vrugtman (below) giving us an update on things she is doing with HBDI and I think it’s “Good News”.   Enjoy your weekend.",High-D
HeHe … I thought I heard that too!    Thank you Jeff!,High-D
Facilitators have been communicated with regarding this upcoming change.,High-D
"I am actually open on Tue as well (it’s showing blocked to 2 am CT because it’s to Midnight PST on my holiday calendar).  And Victoria, just a reminder, I am okay with calls as early as 6 AM PST, so if that works best for you I am good with that.   Back to you Victoria. :)",High-D
"Perhaps we can invite them to the NY cert in November? Or do a BIG push to fill (might be worth it at 3-5 people).    We do have a Facilitator I was supposed to observe at this session (Bradley Humbles from BIG I think, he needs a session to become a Master Facilitator).  I am not 100% sure how to handle this.  I am not sure if he is being paid or this is an “unpaid” training to complete his master certification.  If the venue is free, and I am at expense, and Bradley is at expense, would it be worth it to get him and two people certified?  There may not be a profit, but we would get Bradley trained and two others on their way?   Open to the collective thinking.  What’s needed now?",High-D
Sorry about Olivia not feeling well.  No worries.  I am good with sending what we have. I will send the slide as it to Ann Maxey and we will be complete! ….Until we need to decide who will present it :).,High-D
"Thank you for the brainstorming time and Jeff, for the notes.  I have attached a walk-around version of the notes with a few new ideas.  Please take a look and add, subtract or modify based on your current thinking.  Victoria, I hope you got your daughter in time and have a wonderful evening.  If we do this via email we may not need another call, but whatever works best for all is good for me.",High-D
"Thank you for making the modifications to the offer letter that help clarify our working partnership.  Attached please find signed documents for your files: 1. Offer Letter 2. HI Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete Agreement 3. HI Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement  I still need a link or form for the HI application.  On page 3 of the offer letter, it states I need to complete and sign the Herrmann International Application Form"".  It was not included with the other documents your sent me, can you or someone on the team send this along so I can complete it? """,High-D
Thank you for the feedback on the work with Kyle.  Always good to know about.  I would be happy to be on a call with Tencap Sports.  The initiative sound great!  I know we have think Monday and I would be happy to (may be best if we can) be on a call Mon 10/24 or 10/31.  I am also available 11/1 and after that we jump to 11/8 and forward.  My calendar is current so pick a time that is not already busy for any of those days.  Thanks for thinking of me.,High-D
"Thank you for sending this forward.  I was not aware of this and would LOVE for someone to walk me through the tool.    Christina or Betsy – can one of you schedule time to review this the week of 6/13 – My calendar is current if you want to set up some time.  And as a reminder, any time from 6 am PST on is good.   I look forward to learning more.",High-D
Nice to hear from you. Sorry for the slow reply - my whirlwind is still happening - I am hoping the weekend gives me a bit of a breather.  I have my first draft of the roadmap and will be ready to discuss with you early next week if/as you may have time Sarah.  Let me know a couple of possible times and we can make a meeting.  Sarah - Thank you for the connection and introduction to Brenda - I would love to help with the virtual delivery/design of ANY Herrmann product.  It's fairly straight forward and I enjoy it.  I have worked with Ashley on a price point so there may even be info on the back end in the Herrmann ethers.   Brenda - I would love to catch up.  I am wide open for a call Monday (all day) and Tuesday (up to 1:00 PST).  Is there a good time to catch up?  I am good to be on calls as early as 9:00 AM EST/6:00 AM PST.  I hope you both have a wonderful weekend.,High-D
"Thanks Victoria for checking in and getting the conversation started.  I would like to schedule at least one call to be in a conversation about the company being virtual.  While it’s true many of us are virtual, I think to Jeff’s point, there may be some opportunities for us to share tips and tricks regarding being virtual and I think there is room for a conversation about creating an even better virtual experience for all.   I find myself wondering about the “assumptions” we hold about being virtual that may be missed conversations/opportunities for deeper discussion because it’s so familiar.  Thoughts?  Enjoy the long weekend and the entry into the New Year!",High-D
Thank you for the Personas information.  It's interesting insight.  Wed 3/9 still works -- I am available Wed 3/9 from 1-3 EST/10-12 PST.  If that does not work I am currently open from 11:00 EST on both Thur 3/10 and Friday 3/11.   Just send an invite for what will work best for you.  Please send it to both emails as I don't yet have my computer to track meetings well.  I look forward to connecting soon.,High-D
